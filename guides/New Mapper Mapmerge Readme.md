If you're making a PR to Github, or are a new mapper and have been told to "mapmerge":

Run dmm2tgm.bat, find the map you edited, and type it in. For instance, as of this date/writing, Tether Surface 2 is 163.

If Tether Surface 2 is still 163, type in 163 and hit enter, it will run mapmerge. This reduces the filediff for easier Git merging.

NOTE that this is not "merging" two maps together. ALL YOU ARE DOING IS REDUCING FILEDIFF. IF YOU NEED TO MAPMERGE PROPERLY, @ A DEVELOPER OR SOMEONE WITH MAPPING EXPERIENCE.
