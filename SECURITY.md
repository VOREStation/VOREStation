# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Please check to ensure the vulnerability still exists in the current `master` branch before reporting.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please be as descriptive as possible!

## Older Libraries/Dependencies

Some of our libraries may not be used in a way that makes 
them vulnerable, because we tend to only use a couple of 
functions out of them. If that's the case and we think that 
your vulnerability won't apply to our use-case, then 
it may be closed, even if we're using an older version 
of the library.
