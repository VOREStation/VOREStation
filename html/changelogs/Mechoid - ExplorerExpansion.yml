changes: 
  - bugfix: "Exosuits are now targetted by turrets again."
  - tweak: "Mining charge strength lowered, price increased. Can be upgraded through R&D laser components."
  - rscadd: "Searing damage type added. Energy axe now uses searing damage."
  - rscadd: "Survey points added. Vendor added for explorer use. Costs are universally 'lower' compared to the mining vendor due to the rarity of points."
  - rscadd: "Swiping an ID card on a cataloguer will transfer the points to the card."
  - tweak: "Any melee energy weapon can now be made to use a cell and charge."
  - rscadd: "Energy Axe prototype added to R&D."
  - rscadd: "Anomalous 'hunting trap' added to R&D. Useful for an initial stun on mobs for explorer scanning."
  - tweak: "Beartraps now stun for a quarter of a second, so they are actually useful again, due to resistability."
  - rscadd: "Emergency welding pack added. Incredibly slow, but requires no protection."
  - rscadd: "Random turf modifier added for mapping use. Random humanoid remains spawner added for mapping use."
  - rscadd: "Plants under obj/structure/flora now can be made to be harvestable / forage-able."
  - rscadd: "Sif trees now occasionally have fruit containing useful microbes. Microbes slow blood flow resulting in slower chemical absorption and blood loss."
  - tweak: "Flora by default are now under mobs, on the same layer as turf decals. Flora can now also randomize their size, previously only codified in Sivian trees."
  - rscadd: "Moss tendrils added to Sif, making eye-plants more rare."
  - rscadd: "Multiple PoIs added. 'Blue shuttle down' variant, 'UFO Frigate', multiple geysers, cliffs, and two variants of SFR which take drastically different approaches to the SFR standard. A vault was added, too."
  - tweak: "Vault PoIs are now in a template group."
  - rscadd: "Generic AI-controlled humanoids added. Subtype made for use on Sif, clad in weak armor and temperature resistance, used as 'mindless clones'."
  - rscadd: "More artifice added."
  - tweak: "Fultons made to be [somewhat] sane. Now only useable planetside."
  - tweak: "Graviton Visor moved to R&D from the mining equipment vendor. Silver and Diamond pickaxes removed."
