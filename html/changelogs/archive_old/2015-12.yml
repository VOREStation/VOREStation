  Neerti:
  - rscadd: Adds NanoUI for communicators, the ability for communicators to call other
      communicators on the station, the ability for station-bound people to call ghosts,
      and for ghosts to toggle their visibility to communicators on or off in character
      preferences (defaults to off).  Communicators can now also support more than
      one call at the same time, for both ghosts and normal communicators.
  - rscadd: Adds new machine to telecomms, the Exonet node.  It is very basic in terms
      of functionality, but certain services can be selectively disabled from it,
      such as newscaster updates, communicators, or external PDA messages.  Adds methods
      for building and deconstructing Exonet nodes.
  - experiment: Adds framework for a fake-networking system called EPv2 that communicators
      will now use, and perhaps other machines will in the future, for good or for
      evil.
  - rscdel: Changeling Spacearmor reduced in protective ability.
  - rscdel: Cryogenic String and Delayed Toxic Sting now have a three minute cooldown
      upon stinging someone.
  - rscdel: Cryotoxin, the chemical used in Cryogenic String, is 25% less potent now.
  - rscdel: The rune to summon Narsie has been changed.  Narsie is no longer summoned,
      but Hell still comes.
  - rscdel: Spooky mobs spawned from spooky portals as a result of Hell coming have
      had their speed, health, and damage reduced.
  - rscdel: Manifested humans no longer count for summoning Hell.
  - experiment: Changes how armor calculations work.  All the armor values remain
      the same, but the 'two dice rolls' system has been replaced with a mix of reliable
      damage reduction and a bit of RNG to keep things interesting.  The intention
      is to make weaker armor more relevent and stronger armor less overpowered.
  - tweak: When you are hit, it uses the armor protection as a base amount to protect
      you from, then it does a roll between +25% and -25% of that base protection,
      and adds it to the base protection. The result of that is how much damage is
      reduced from the attack.  For example, if you are hit by an energy sword in
      the chest while wearing armor that has 50 melee protection, the base protection
      is 50, then RNG can make the final protection be between 37.5 and 62.5 percent.
      The damage you'd take could range from 11.25 to 18.75, instead of 0, 15, or
      30.  Remember that some weapons can penetrate armor.
  - rscadd: Added personal communicators, a device that enables someone to talk to
      someone else at vast distances.  You can talk to people who are far from the
      station, so long as telecommunications remains operational.
  - rscadd: To use, become a ghost, then use the appropiate verb and pick a communicator
      to call.  Then you wait until someone picks up.  Once that occurs, you will
      be placed inside the communicator.  The voice you use is your currently loaded
      character.  Languages are supported as well.
  - tweak: Round-end is now three minutes instead of one, and counts down, to allow
      for some more post-round roleplay.  If the station blows up for whatever reason,
      the old one minute restart is retained.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscdel: Manual radio frequency changes can no longer go outside the standard frequency
      span.
  - rscadd: Users with sufficient access can instead select pre-defined channels outside
      this span, such as department channels, when using intercoms.
  Zuhayr:
  - tweak: Aiming has been rewritten, keep an eye out for weird behavior.
  - rscdel: Removed the detective scanner and associated machinery.
  - rscadd: Added a microscope, machine forensic scanner, etc. from Aurora forensics.
