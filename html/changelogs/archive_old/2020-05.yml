  Atermonera:
  - rscadd: Added a preference to control multilingual parsing behaviour, with a few
      different modes. Should hopefully be less punishing to people who stutter and
      use hyphens as a language key.
  - tweak: The examine mode preference should now persist across reconnections during
      a single round, but if the server is fully restarted it still appears to reset.
      This issue is also present for the multilingual preference, and I'm still looking
      into it. Savefiles are cryptic.
  Layne:
  - rscadd: Added Promethean language.
  Mechoid:
  - rscadd: Adds more interactions with animals, like shearing and taming.
  - rscadd: New PoIs
  - rscadd: Thermal poncho attachment, has minor slowdown, but gives thermal protection
      to the armor it is attached to.
  - rscadd: Mercenaries now drop their guns again. Most likely to be broken, however
      they can be repaired. Examining when adjacent will allow you to inspect the
      gun for what is needed.
  - rscadd: Mercenary Snipers now exist. They will telegraph their shots approximately
      2 seconds in advance, and can fire at 14 tiles away. Will occasionally drop
      pieces of their PTRs that survive combat.
  - tweak: Clothing can now check attachments for temperature resistance.
  - bugfix: MHD Howitzer beam effect actually exists again.
  - bugfix: Xenoresin ground cover is properly colored again.
  atlantiscze:
  - rscadd: Robots can now search loot piles.
  - rscadd: Hardsuits now allow backpacks to be carried in storage slot. This is limited
      to hardsuits which are worn on the back slot.
  - rscadd: SMES units now have automatic load balancing both on inputs and outputs
  - rscadd: SMES units (and derived objects, such as PSUs) can now have more than
      one input terminal. This allows for input from more otherwise isolated power
      networks.
  - tweak: Completely redesigned cell rack PSUs, removed ghetto variant. Cell rack
      PSUs now support multiple power cells and hot-swapping of cells during operation.
      This allows for either charging multiple cells at once in one device (directly
      from power cable) or for powering up various machinery with only a power cell.
      They are still inferior to SMESes in pretty much all aspects.
  - tweak: Multitool on a cable now shows nicer results with large currents (uses
      kW or MW accordingly)
  - tweak: Multitool may be now used to change colour of cable coils.
  - tweak: Supermatter delamination effects have been tweaked. Delamination is considerably
      less laggy, and less directly destructive. Instead, it causes larger health
      hazard and secondary engineering problems such as power outage or partial damage
      of solar arrays.
