  Anewbe:
  - bugfix: Adult Diona should be able to name themselves properly now. Tweaked from
      a Baystation PR by FTangSteve.
  - rscdel: Lightning spells and bioelectrogenesis will no longer stun outright.
  - rscadd: FBPs should no longer get mutations from radiation.
  - bugfix: Observe warning should properly show how long you have before you can
      join.
  - rscadd: Adds a Toggle Shoe Layer verb to shoes, that let them be worn over the
      uniform (ie tucking your pants into your shoes).
  - bugfix: Shoes now properly check if they can hold knives or not.
  - bugfix: Sign language can now be used while muzzled.
  Datraen:
  - tweak: Skrell are now more resistant to various chemicals, more susceptible to
      pepperspray.
  ForFoxSake:
  - bugfix: Fixed a possible href exploit allowing any living player to speak any
      language.
  - bugfix: Organic beings can no longer speak Encoded Audio Language, although they
      can still understand it just fine.
  - tweak: Positronic brains can now speak Encoded Audio Language.
  - tweak: Station manufactured Full Body Prosthetics can now speak Encoded Audio
      Language.
  MagmaRam:
  - tweak: Corpses will now process a select few chemicals, meaning you can now add
      blood into people who bled out before defibbing them.
  - bugfix: Defibrilators fixed again.
  - bugfix: R&D machines will now accept stacks of metal and glass from Cargo orders
      properly.
  N3X15:
  - bugfix: Electrical storms no longer affect only cargo. If you're not cargo, your
      lights are no longer safe.
  Nerezza:
  - rscadd: APCs now have a new EMP behavior. Regular APCs shut off for a few minutes,
      critical APCs (engine and AI) shut off for 30ish seconds. Medbay will now not
      be permanently disabled by EMPs if no engineers are available to fix their APCs.
  - rscadd: Bay's timed reboot interface for APCs has been ported for EMPed APCs.
  - tweak: APCs affected by grid checks say so on their nanoUI now.
  - tweak: APCs damaged by the apc_damage random event are now effectively emagged
      APCs. Anyone can operate their interface.
  - tweak: Emagged APCs can now be repaired by removing their power cell and using
      a multitool to 'reboot' them manually.
  - bugfix: Nin and twiz no longer **** up APCs if they drain the battery completely.
  - tweak: Nin and twiz drain power from the wire an APC is connected to first, then
      drain from the power cell to fill the drain's 'quota'. Because the amount of
      power given from the power net is random, this means the battery will still
      drain but this also means you don't need to crowbar tiles in a room if the APC
      is empty.
  - bugfix: Bluescreened APC wire panels now visibly open like they should.
  - tweak: Bashing APCs open was only effective under certain circumstances, but would
      spam everyone anyway. This has been changed to only spam the user and to be
      more indicative of when you can bash the cover off.
  - spellcheck: Full grammar pass on APCs.
  - rscadd: Hazard shutters animate slightly and play a sound so players can more
      readily identify where shutters are being pried.
  - bugfix: Two people can't pry the same shutter simultaneously anymore.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug causing shutters to immediately pry open when people didn't
      want the shutter open.
  - rscadd: Inflatables can be deflated using ctrl-click.
  - rscadd: Inflatables can be deployed on adjacent tiles by clicking them.
  - bugfix: Bumping into closed inflatable doors will no longer freeze them for a
      few moments.
  Yoshax:
  - maptweak: All Heads of Staff now get multi-color pens in their office.
  - tweak: Doors that do not have an access requirement can now be opened when handcuffed.

  Atermonera:
  - bugfix: Science grippers can install and remove borg components
  - bugfix: Exosuit grippers can install exosuit equipment
  - bugfix: Sheetloaders can load materials into protolathes and circuit imprinters.
  - tweak: Protolathes and circuit imprinters input materials like autolathes, taking
      as much of the fed stack as it can.
  MagmaRam:
  - tweak: Beakers can now have longer labels.
  - rscadd: Adds defibrilator crate for cargo.
  - tweak: Changed how certain stacks spawn behind the scenes. Should fix a few esoteric
      bugs without impacting anything else.

      actually occur now.
  - rscadd: Added new arithmetic circuits; sign, round, and exponent.
