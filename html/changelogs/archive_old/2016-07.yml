  Aztectornado:
  - tweak: Clicking a stack of sheets (Metal, phoron...) in your other hand now asks
      how many you want to split off the stack, courtesy of Baycode
  Datraen:
  - rscadd: Antagonistic factions can now be set and viewed on the uplink. Visibilities
      can be set for these as well, to help identify sympathizers/potential aids,

  - tweaks: Increases max records and book length to ridiculous levels.
  Yoshax:
  - tweak: The PTR Sniper is now more accurate when scoped, but less accurate when
      unscoped. In addition it now has more recoil.

      shot at a time. This is because the beams it fires now do 90 damage with 100
      armor penetration. Furthermore, it is now considerably more accurate. Lastly,
      to counteract it only holding one shot at a time, it now autorecharges, which
      takes 60 seconds.

      not only 20+.
  Neerti:
  - rscadd: Adds ability for ghosts to send and receive text messages via communicator.
