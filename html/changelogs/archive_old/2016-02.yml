  Datraen:
  - rscadd: Moderators can now see and use AOOC.
  - bugfix: Other synthetics given EAL.
  - bugfix: Trays now drop items when placed on table, dropped.
  - bugfix: Objects can now be yanked out of synthetics.
  - tweak: Respawn time moved down from 30 minutes to 15 minutes.
  - rscadd: Telecrystal item added for trading telecrystals between traitors and mercenaries.
  - rscadd: Telecrystal item now has tech values.
  EmperorJon:
  - tweak: Traitor synths can no longer be locked down from the robotics console.
      Attempting to lock them down (or release the lockdown) notifies the synth of
      the attempt and updates the console's UI as normal.
  Neerti:
  - rscadd: Suit cooling units can now be attached to voidsuits.  Note that coolers
      and air tanks are mutually exclusive.
  - bugfix: EMP no longer hits twice on humans.
  - tweak: EMP drains powercells using the cell's current charge, and not the cell's
      maximum potential charge, to ensure two blasts do not completely disable a synthetic.
  - tweak: EMP hitting a prosthetic limb or organ will now do less damage.
  - tweak: EMP hitting a cyborg will no longer outright stun them.  Instead, they
      gain the 'confused' status for a few moments, making movement difficult.  In
      addition, their HUD gets staticy, and their modules are forced to be retracted.
  - rscadd: Stasis bags will protect the occupant from the outside enviroment's atmosphere.
  - rscadd: Stasis bags can be hit with a health analyzer to analyze the occupant.
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Drones can now pull a variety of things (such as scrubbers). This came
      with a pulling refactor so please report any strangeness with pulling in general.
  - rscadd: Drones (and any mob that can be picked up) can be bashed against airlocks
      and such to use their internal access, so long as the person using them does
      not have an ID card equipped.
  - rscadd: Added foam weapons to cargo for LARP shenanigans.
  - rscadd: Added the ability to equip grenades to the mask slot, and to prime them
      by clicking someone with harm intent targeting the mouth.
  - rscadd: Removed the species restrictions on transplanted internal organs. Have
      fun.
  - rscadd: Added 'full body' prosthetic options to character generation.
  - rscadd: Removed IPC. No tears were shed.
  - rscadd: 'RE: borgs, Renamed ''robot'' type to ''drone'' and ''android'' type to
      ''robot'' for clarity with new ''android'' human mobs.'
  - rscadd: Rejuvenate will now reapply robolimb/autopsy data.
  - rscadd: Lots of backend work relating to the above. If you're a coder go look
      at the PR or ask Zuhayr for details.
  - rscdel: Removed brute and burn resist from robolimbs, removed sever vulnerability
      from robolimbs.
  - rscadd: Added a config option for visible human death messages.
  - rscadd: pAIs and small mobs can now bump open doors.
  - rscadd: Added functionality for two-handed guns; these guns will give an accuracy
      penalty if fired without an empty offhand.
  - rscadd: Unified two-handed melee weapons with the above; while the offhand is
      empty, the weapon will count as wielded.
