  Mechoid:
  - rscadd: 'Adds two new integrated circuit components: an advanced Text to Speech,
      and a Sign-Language reading camera.'
  Nalarac:
  - tweak: Lowered Chance of bots being emagged during ion storm.
  - tweak: Changes space helmet cameras to be a verb instead of on toggling lights.
  - rscadd: Toggling helmet camera resets user upon activation (so you can have a
      new user).
  - bugfix: Medibots will no longer attempt to heal FBPs.
  - tweak: Heavy-duty cell chargers can be built and upgraded.
  - bugfix: Cyborgs can upgrade rechargers now.
  - bugfix: Security bots will smack attackers once more.
  - tweak: Security bots will cable cuff people with hardsuit gauntlets instead of
      stun-locking.
  - tweak: Cut real time for security bots demanding surrender in half (6 seconds).
  - tweak: Updates the Supermatter Engine Operating Manual.
  mistyLuminescence:

2019-08-21:
  Atermonera:
  - tweak: Atmospherics is now bigger, with more room for fun and sanity-destroying
      spaghetti!
  Mechoid:
  - bugfix: Exosuits are now targetted by turrets again.
  - tweak: Mining charge strength lowered, price increased. Can be upgraded through
      R&D laser components.
  - rscadd: Searing damage type added. Energy axe now uses searing damage.
  - rscadd: Survey points added. Vendor added for explorer use. Costs are universally
      'lower' compared to the mining vendor due to the rarity of points.
  - rscadd: Swiping an ID card on a cataloguer will transfer the points to the card.
  - tweak: Any melee energy weapon can now be made to use a cell and charge.
  - rscadd: Energy Axe prototype added to R&D.
  - rscadd: Anomalous 'hunting trap' added to R&D. Useful for an initial stun on mobs
      for explorer scanning.
  - tweak: Beartraps now stun for a quarter of a second, so they are actually useful
      again, due to resistability.
  - rscadd: Emergency welding pack added. Incredibly slow, but requires no protection.
  - rscadd: Random turf modifier added for mapping use. Random humanoid remains spawner
      added for mapping use.
  - rscadd: Plants under obj/structure/flora now can be made to be harvestable / forage-able.
  - rscadd: Sif trees now occasionally have fruit containing useful microbes. Microbes
      slow blood flow resulting in slower chemical absorption and blood loss.
  - tweak: Flora by default are now under mobs, on the same layer as turf decals.
      Flora can now also randomize their size, previously only codified in Sivian
      trees.
  - rscadd: Moss tendrils added to Sif, making eye-plants more rare.
  - rscadd: Multiple PoIs added. 'Blue shuttle down' variant, 'UFO Frigate', multiple
      geysers, cliffs, and two variants of SFR which take drastically different approaches
      to the SFR standard. A vault was added, too.
  - tweak: Vault PoIs are now in a template group.
  - rscadd: Generic AI-controlled humanoids added. Subtype made for use on Sif, clad
      in weak armor and temperature resistance, used as 'mindless clones'.
  - rscadd: More artifice added.
  - tweak: Fultons made to be [somewhat] sane. Now only useable planetside.
  - tweak: Graviton Visor moved to R&D from the mining equipment vendor. Silver and
      Diamond pickaxes removed.
  - rscadd: Added multiple new organs for Prometheans. Removing them will cause them
      to take large amounts of Toxloss untill they are Regenerated using the active
      regeneration verb.
  - rscadd: 'Organ: pneumatic network, a series of skeletal tubes with high pressure
      used to move nutrients and waste.'
  - rscadd: 'Organs: -regenesis systems, different ''networks'' of clumped cellular
      matter that allow Prometheans to recover rapidly from small injuries. Large
      or numerous injuries cause un-needed stress, and pain.'
  - bugfix: Internal organs now properly add themselves to the internal organ-by-name
      list, the one referenced 99.9% of the time.
  - tweak: Active regeneration will now replace internal organs if they are nonexistant,
      as it does for limbs.
  Nalarac:
  - bugfix: Mech cable layer works again.
  - rscadd: Added setting for turrets to fire upon downed/laying targets.
  TheFurryFeline:
  - rscadd: New orange jumpsuit for loadout that doesn't get locked to tracking.
  - tweak: Prison jumpsuit filepath changed accordingly and closets with obj updated.
  Woodrat:
  - tweak: Made the solgov uniforms use accessories for denoting department instead
      of having several different sprites in the uniform dmi folder.
  - tweak: Removed redundant solgov uniforms from uniform.dmi and moved the sprites
      for the solgov uniforms to their own dmi.
  - bugfix: Fixed storage vests and drop pouches disappearing when one rolls down
      a uniform.
