  Atermonera:
  - tweak: Stairs have been completely reworked, and now consist of multi-tile constructs
      built from lower, middle, and upper stair pieces, and an openspace in the floor.
  - rscadd: To go up and down stairs, simply step upon the lower/upper stair pieces,
      and you'll be moved automatically if the stairs are in working condition. Any
      grabbed or dragged items will be brought with you.
  - rscadd: If the lower stair piece is missing (or even if it's not), but the middle
      and upper sections are present, you can climb up the middle section by click-dragging
      from your character to the middle stair.
  - rscadd: If you step onto the open space, you will fall down the stairs. Teshari
      players, consider yourselves warned.
  - rscadd: Stairs remain unconstructable in-round (Doing so would also require a
      way to make openspaces), but there are spawners rooted on the middle stair (as
      with old stairs) that will create a completed stair and can be spawned in by
      admins/mappers.

  - tweak: The textual indicators at the bottom of the hacking window will now go
      bold when they change, until the next window refresh.
  - tweak: Hacking an Autolathe no longer requires you to hack it using the Autolathe's
      main window, but instead opens the hacking window like everything else.
