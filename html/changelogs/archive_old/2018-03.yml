  Anewbe:
  - tweak: Pills and ingested reagents actually process at half speed, rather than
      just ignoring half of the reagents.
  - rscdel: Robotic limbs now need internal repair at 30 composite damage, rather
      than 30 of burn or brute.
  - tweak: Syringes now inject their entire payload with one click, but in 5 unit
      increments. There is a delay in between each of these.
  - rscadd: Assisted robotic organs (internals, eyes) are less vulnerable to EMP.
  - rscdel: Lifelike robotic organs (currently VeyMed) are more vulnerable to EMP.
  Cerebulon:
  - rscadd: Added Akhani language for Tajaran.
  - spellcheck: Fixed incorrect singular form of Tajaran in several places.
  MisterLayne:
  - rscadd: Added a version of the ED-209 called the ED-CLN. It is a more efficient
      Cleanbot.
  - bugfix: Reinforced snowballs can now actually be made in a reasonable time limit.
  Nerezza:
  - tweak: Broken APCs can be bashed open with slightly smaller objects now. This
      means wrenches are acceptable, no need to hunt down a fire extinguisher.
  - rscdel: EVA rigsuit/hardsuit no longer holds toolboxes in suit storage since those
      have been a volume inventory for some time now. RIP ghetto satchel.
  - rsctweak: CE's rigsuit/hardsuit no longer holds pickaxes and ore satchels, but
      can now hold inflateables.
  - bugfix: Retracting rigsuit/hardsuit helmets with no valid mask equipped now disables
      internals.
  - bugfix: Offline rigsuits/hardsuits are no longer considered valid air supplies
      by the internals button. Before, your internals would instantly shut off before
      you could get a breath out of the rigsuit. Now, the internals button will look
      for a different tank instead.
  - rscadd: Tajaran now get to keep their tails when they wear the EVA, RD, or Industrial
      rigsuits/hardsuits. Unathi sprites to come soon!
  - bugfix: Sifwood floor tiles now correctly use their double-stacked icon instead
      of disappearing.

  - rscadd: Added in a weapons crate for explorers that has bolt action rifles.
  - rscadd: Weapon powercells can be ordered from cargo (security access crate).

      the rifle. Minor adjustments to other munitions and security supply packs as
      well.
  - rscadd: The automatic weapons ammo crate has also been split.
  - tweak: Names of the crates for the munitions and security catogory supply packs
      have been adjusted slightly. In certain places contents also adjusted.
  - bugfix: Holoplant now comes in a crate.
