  - tweak: Some maintenance doors within RnD and Medbay have had their accesses changed.
      Maintenance doors in the joint areas (leading to the research shuttle, virology,
      and xenobiology) are now zero access. Which means anyone in those joints can
      enter the maintenance tunnels. This was done to add additional evacuation locations
      during radiation storms. Additional maintenance doors were added to the tunnels
      in these areas to prevent docs and scientists from running about.
  - tweak: Starboard emergency storage isn't gone now, it's simply located in the
      escape wing.
  - experiment: An engineering training room has been added to engineering. This location
      was previously where surgery was located. If you are new to engineering or need
      to brush up on your skills, please use this area for testing.

      with the shotgun.
  - bugfix: Portable air pumps now fill based on external/airtank pressure when pumping
      in.
2015-05-16:
  GinjaNinja32:
  - rscadd: Rewrote tables. To construct a table, use steel to make a table frame,
      then plate the frame with a material such as steel, gold, wood, etc. Hold a
      stack in your hand and drag it to the table to reinforce it. To deconstruct
      a table, use a screwdriver to remove the reinforcements (if present), then a
      wrench to remove the plating, and a wrench again to dismantle the frame. Use
      a welder to repair any damage. Use a carpet tile on a table to add felt, and
      a crowbar to remove it.
  HarpyEagle:

      injected (syringes, IV drips), and put on the skin (sprays, beaker splashing).
  - tweak: Injecting food and drinks will cause bad effects.
  - tweak: Healing reagents, generally speaking, have stronger effects when injected.

  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: Destroying a camera by brute force now has a chance to break the wiring
      within.
  - rscadd: Turf are now processed. This, for example, causes radioactive walls to
      regularly irradiate nearby mobs.

  - bugfix: Goats will eat the spawning plants for vines as well as the vines themselves.
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Ghetto diagnosis. Grab patient, aim at bodypart you want to check, click
      on them with help intent. This will tell you about their wounds, fractures and
      other oddities (toxins/oxygen) for that bodypart.
  - rscadd: Fractures are visible on very damaged limbs. Dislocations are always visible.
      Surgery incisions now visible too.

  - rscadd: Re-implemented fuel fires. Tweaked fire behaviour overall.
  Yoshax:
  - tweak: Bear traps now do damage when stood on, enough to break bones! Bear traps
      can now affect any limb of a person who is on the ground, including head! Bear
      traps are no longer legcuffs and instead embed in the limb they attack.
  - tweak: Bear traps now take several seconds to deploy and cannot be picked up when
      armed, they must be disarmed by clicking on them. They also cannot be moved
      then they are deployed.
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Massive material refactor. Walls, beds, chairs, stools, tables, ashtrays,
      knives, baseball bats, axes, simple doors, barricades, so on.
  - rscadd: Tables are now built via steel then another sheet on the resulting frame.
      They can then be reinforced by dragging a stack of sheets onto the table.
  - rscadd: Walls are built with steel for girders, then right-click the girder and
      select the reinforce verb while holding a stack, then click the girders with
      a final sheet.
  - rscadd: Various things can be built with various sheet types. Experiment! Just
      keep in mind that uranium is now radioactive and phoron is now flammable.
2015-05-26:
  Atlantis:
  - rscadd: NanoUI for Robotics Control Console
  - rscadd: NanoUI for Supermatter Crystal - AI/Robot only, purely informational
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: Meat limbs now can be attached. Use limb on missing area, then hemostat
      to finalize it.
  - rscadd: Limbs from other races can be now attached. They'll cause rejection, but
      it can be kept at bay with spaceacilline to some point. Species special attack
      is carried over too, i.e. you can clawn people if you sew a cathand to yourself.
  - rscadd: Limbs that are left in open will rot in ~7 minutes. Use freezers or cryobags
      to stop it. You can still attach them, but you wish you couldn't.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: Both the pulse taker and target must now remain still for the duration
      of the check or it will fail.
  RavingManiac:
  - rscadd: Tape recorders now record hearable emotes and action messages (e.g. gunshots).
  - bugfix: You can now see actions from inside mechs and closets.
  Techhead:
  - rscadd: Removed gaseous reagents from the chemistry system and replaced with real-world
      organic chemistry precursors.
  - rscadd: Hydrogen has been replaced with hydrazine, a highly toxic, flammable liquid.
  - rscadd: Oxygen has been replaced with acetone, a mildly toxic liquid. Ethanol's
      ink-sovlent capabilities have been copied to it.
  - rscadd: Chlorine has been replaced with hydrochloric acid. It is a stronger acid
      than sulphuric but less toxic.
  - tweak: Nitrogen has been replaced with ammonia. Ammonia now acts as a Dexalin-equivalent
      for Vox.
  - tweak: Flourine has also been replaced with hydrazine in its one recipe. Flourosurficant
      has been renamed azosurficant.
  - tweak: Being splashed with liquid Phoron will burn eyes and contaminate clothes
      like being exposed to Phoron gas.
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Added a ghost requisition system for posibrains and living plants.
  - rscadd: Added attack_ghost() to hydro trays and posibrains to allow ghosts to
      enter them.
  - rscadd: Prosthetic limbs are now only repairable with welders/cable coils if they
      have suffered below 30 combined damage.
  - rscadd: 'Surgery steps that cause no pain and have no failure wounding have been
      added: screwdriver for ''incision'', crowbar to open, multitool to ''decouple''
      a prosthetic organ. Hemostat is still used to take an organ out.'
  - rscadd: Using a welder or a cable coil as a surgical tool after opening a maintenance
      hatch will repair damage beyond the 30 damage cap. In other words, severe damage
      to robolimbs requires expert repair from someone else.
  - rscdel: Eye and brain surgery were removed; they predate the current organ system
      and are redundant.
  - rscadd: IPC are now simply full prosthetic bodies using a specific manufacturer
      (Morpheus Cyberkinetics).
  - rscadd: IPC can 'recharge' in a cyborg station to regain nutriment. They no longer
      interface with APCs.
  - rscadd: NO_BLOOD flag now bypasses ingested and blood reagent processing.
  - rscadd: NO_SCAN now bypasses mutagen reagent effects.
  - rscadd: Cyborg analyzers now show damage to prosthetic limbs and organs on humans.

  - rscadd: Unfolded pAIs can now be scooped up and worn as hats.
  - tweak: Scoop-up behavior is now standardized to selecting help intent and dragging
      their icon onto yours.
2015-05-30:
  Atlantis:
  - rscadd: Malfunction Overhaul - Whole gamemode was completely reworked from scratch.
      Most old abilities have been removed and quite a lot of new abilities was added.
      AI also has to hack APCs to unlock higher tier abilities faster, instead of
      having access to them from the round start. Most forced things, such as, shuttle
      recalling were removed and are instead controlled by the AI. Code is fully modular
      allowing for future modifications.
  HarpyEagle:
  - bugfix: Fixes Engineer ERT gloves not being insulated.
  - tweak: IV stands are no longer bullet shields. They also allow mice, drones, pAIs
      et al to pass though.
  Kelenius:
  - tweak: AI now hears LOOC both around its eye and its core, and speaks in LOOC
      around its eye. Keep in mind that you won't hear and won't be heard if there
      is a wall between your eye and the target.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: You can now review the server revision date and hash by using the 'Show
      Server Revision' verb in the OOC category.

      unless subverted/malfunctioning.
  - bugfix: Astral projecting mobs, such as wizards or cultists, may no longer respawn
      as something else while their body lives.
  Techhead:
  - rscadd: Prison break event has been expanded to include Virology or Xenobiology
  - rscadd: Prison break event will warn Enginering and the AI beforehand so they
      can take preventive measures.
  - bugfix: Disabling area power will now prevent doors from opening during the event
2015-06-05:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - bugfix: Split stacks no longer lose their coloring.
  - tweak: Can no longer merge cables of different colors.
  - tweak: Blobs and simple mobs now attack all external organs instead of a subset.
      The overall damage remains the same but the number of fractures caused will,
      in general, be fewer.
  - rscadd: Spider nurses now have a chance of injecting their victims with spider
      eggs which eventually hatch. If the limb is removed from the host, the host
      dies, or the spiderling has matured sufficiently it will crawl out into freedom.
      Medical scanners will pick upp eggs and spiderlings as foreign bodies.
  Yoshax:
  - tweak: Makes hyposprays start empty instead of filled with Tricord.
  - tweak: Makes the special wizard projectile staffs, Animate, Change, Focus and
      any future ones only usable by wizards. Also makes it so only wizards can use
      spellbooks and teleportation scrolls.
2015-06-08:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: The AI chassis now glows, with the color depending on the currently selected
      display.
2015-06-09:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: Ports /tg/'s meteor event. Meteors now appear to be more accurate, come
      in a greater variety, and may drop ores on their final destruction.
2015-06-16:
  Chinsky:
  - rscadd: 'Updated penlights to be more of use in diagnostics, they now show following
      conditions:'
  - rscadd: Eye damage
  - rscadd: Blurry eyes (overall slower reaction)
  - rscadd: Brain damage (one eye reacts slower)
  - rscadd: Opiates use (pinpoint pupils)
  - rscadd: Drugs use (dilated pupils)
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscadd: Observers can now follow both the AI and its eye upon speech.
  - rscadd: Observers can now follow both observers and their body, if they ever had
      one, upon speech.

  Techhead:
  - rscadd: Converted Request Console interface into NanoUI.
2015-06-19:
  HarpyEagle:

      Mob fires also burn hotter.
  - rscadd: Matches can now be used to light things adjacent to you when thrown.
  - tweak: Made the effects of having a damaged robotic leg more prominent.
  - bugfix: Robot limbs no longer cause pain messages. A reminder that you can still
      check their status with 'Help Intent' -> 'Click Self'.
  - tweak: Knifing damage scales with weapon force and throat protection. Helmets
      only provide throat protection if they are air tight. Trying to cut someone's
      throat with wirecutters and/or while wearing an armoured sealed helmet will
      require several attempts before the victim passes out.
  - tweak: Knifing switches on harm intent, in case you just wanted to beat on the
      victim for some reason.
  - bugfix: Prevents knifing bots or silicons.
2015-06-22:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: The traitor uplink no longer displays all items in a long list, instead
      has categories which when accessed shows the relevant items.
2015-06-24:
  HarpyEagle:
  - bugfix: Fixed Tajaran name generation producing names without a space between
      first and last.
  - wip: Adds docking to the mercenary shuttle. Works similarly to other shuttles,
      except docking and undocking is manually initiated and not automatic. A system
      to approve or deny dock requests still to be implemented.
  - rscadd: Toolboxes can now hold larger items, such as stacks of metal or power
      cells, at the cost of having less space for other things.
  - tweak: Gloves/shoes can now be worn even if you have one hand/foot missing. The
      other one still has to be present, of course. The items still drop when you
      first lose the hand/foot.
  - tweak: Budget insulated gloves are somewhat less useless. On average, they will
      stop half the damage from getting shocked, and the worst case insulation is
      not as bad as it used to be. Budget gloves that are as good as regular insulated
      gloves are still as rare as they were before though.
  - tweak: PTR bullets are now hitscan, to make them somewhat better for actual sniping.
  - maptweak: The telecoms server room now has an actual cycling airlock into it.
  - tweak: Non-vital body parts will no longer take further damage above a certain
      amount, and will inflict paincrit effects instead. On most humaniods the head,
      chest, and groin are vital.
  - rscadd: 'Engineers now spawn with industrial workboots (credit: ChessPiece/Bishop).'
  - bugfix: Damaged robotic legs now more likely to have an effect.
  - bugfix: Fixed bug preventing internal organs from taking damage in some cases.
  - maptweak: New flavours of tables around the station. Engineering starts with more
      plastic.
  - bugfix: Fixed worn items not appearing in some cases. Most notably crossbows and
      certain guns when worn on the back. As a side effect, laundry machines no longer
      transform items.
  - bugfix: Crit oxyloss now runs in game time instead of real time. So if lag is
      slowing your movement the same slowdown applies to the dying person you're trying
      to reach.
  - rscadd: Breathmasks can now be adjusted by clicking on them in your hand, in addition
      to the verb.
  - rscadd: Wearing a space helmet or similar face-covering gear now prevents eating
      and force-feeding food, drink, and pills.
  - rscadd: Phoron in air ignites above it's flashpoint temperature and a certain
      (very small) minimum concentration. Environments that have oxygen and are hot
      enough, and have phoron but not enough concentration to burn will produce flareouts,
      which are mostly a visual effect.
  - rscadd: Adds animation when making unarmed attacks or attacking with melee weapons,
      to help make it clearer who is attacking.
  - soundadd: Opening an unpowered door now has an appropriate sound.
  - rscadd: Ingesting diseased blood may contract the disease.

      area restrictions. Admins can operate these from the central checkpoint.
2015-07-04:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - tweak: Portable turrets now only blocks movement while deployed.
  - tweak: Portable turrets are no longer invincible while undeployed, however they
      have increased damage resistance in this state.
  - bugfix: Crescent portable turrets should no longer act up during attempts to (un)wrench
      and alter their settings.
2015-07-06:
  GinjaNinja32:

  - tweak: Wizards can no longer etheral jaunt unto turfs that contain solid objects.
2015-07-27:
  Kelenius:
  - tweak: Borg shaker now works similarly to hypospray. It generates reagents that
      can be poured into glasses.
  - bugfix: Therefore, they can no longer duplicate rare reagents such as phoron.
2015-07-29:
  Karolis2011:
  - rscadd: Made tagger and sorting pipes dispensible.
  - bugfix: Unwelding and welding sorting/tagger pipes, no longer delete data about
      them.
2015-07-31:
  HarpyEagle:
  - bugfix: Fixed projectiles being able to hit people in body parts that they don't
      have. This will also mean that the less limbs someone has the less effective
      they will be as a body shield.
2015-08-11:
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - experiment: 0.1.19 is live.
  - tweak: Crew monitors now update every 5th second instead of every other. Reduces
      lag and gives antags a larger window of opportunity to disable suit sensors
      if they have to harm someone.
2015-08-13:
  GinjaNinja32:
  - rscadd: Changed language selection to allow multiple language selections, changed
      humans/unathi/tajarans/skrell to not automatically gain their racial language,
      instead adding it to the selectable languages for that species. Old slots will
      warn when loaded that the languages may not be what you expect.
  Orelbon:
  - rscadd: Changed the HoP's suit to more bibrant colors and hopefully you will like
      it.
2015-08-14:
  HarpyEagle:
  - spellcheck: Renames many guns to follow a consistent naming style. Updated and
      changed gun description text to be more lore-friendly.
  - rscadd: Throwing a booze bottle at something nearby while on harm intent causes
      it to smash, splashing it's contents over whatever it hits.
  - rscadd: Rags can now be wrung out over a container or the floor, emptying it's
      contents into the container or splashing them on the floor.
  - rscadd: Rags can now be soaked using the large water and fuel tanks instead of
      just beakers.
  - rscadd: Rags soaked in welding fuel can be lit on fire.

      stuffed rag is dropped onto the ground.
  - bugfix: Fixed eggs having a ridiculously large chemical volume.
  - rscadd: T-Ray scanner effects are now only visible to the person holding the scanner.
  - rscadd: Traitors can now purchase the C-20r and the STS-35 for telecrystals.
  PsiOmegaDelta:

  - rscadd: Paper can now be crumpled by using in-hand while on hurt intent.
  - rscadd: Library Computer External Archive is now sortable.
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Click a hat on a drone with help intent to equip it. Drag the drone onto
      yourself with grab intent to remove it.
2015-08-15:
  Kelenius:
  - rscadd: Bees have been updated and are totally worth checking out (beekeeping
      crate at cargo).
  - rscdel: Sleeper consoles removed. All interaction is now done by clicking on the
      sleeper itself.
  - tweak: To put people into sleeper, you now have to click-drag people to it. Grabs
      no longer work. To exit the sleeper, move.
  - tweak: Sleeper now uses a NanoUI.
2015-08-16:
  HarpyEagle:
  - tweak: The unathi breacher is now only wearable by unathi.

  - bugfix: Mechanical traps no longer spawn in the janitor's locker.
  - rscadd: Mechanical traps can now be printed with a hacked autolathe.
  - rscadd: Adds armour penetration mechanic for projectiles and melee weapons.
  - rscadd: Laser carbines, LWAP, and shotgun now have a small amount of armour penetration,
      ballistic rifles (not SMGs) have moderate amounts, laser cannon has high armour
      penetration, and the PTR mostly ignores body armour.
  - tweak: 'Shotgun slugs and Z8/STS damage has been lowered slightly to accomodate
      for their higher penetration. In general ballistics deal less damage but have
      higher penetration than comparable laser weapons. Notable exception: X-Ray lasers
      have had their damage lowered slightly but gain very high armour penetration.'
  - rscadd: Energy swords now have very high armour penetration. Ninja blades do less
      damage but ignore armour completely.
  Kelenius:
  - experiment: Click cooldowns have been removed on pretty much everything that isn't
      an attack.
  PsiOmegaDelta:

      real guns but probably shouldn't.

      communicators on the station, the ability for station-bound people to call ghosts,
      and for ghosts to toggle their visibility to communicators on or off in character
      preferences (defaults to off).  Communicators can now also support more than
      one call at the same time, for both ghosts and normal communicators.
  - rscadd: Adds new machine to telecomms, the Exonet node.  It is very basic in terms
      of functionality, but certain services can be selectively disabled from it,
      such as newscaster updates, communicators, or external PDA messages.  Adds methods
      for building and deconstructing Exonet nodes.

      will now use, and perhaps other machines will in the future, for good or for

      had their speed, health, and damage reduced.
  - rscdel: Manifested humans no longer count for summoning Hell.
  - experiment: Changes how armor calculations work.  All the armor values remain
      the same, but the 'two dice rolls' system has been replaced with a mix of reliable
      damage reduction and a bit of RNG to keep things interesting.  The intention
      is to make weaker armor more relevent and stronger armor less overpowered.
  - tweak: When you are hit, it uses the armor protection as a base amount to protect
      you from, then it does a roll between +25% and -25% of that base protection,
      and adds it to the base protection. The result of that is how much damage is
      reduced from the attack.  For example, if you are hit by an energy sword in
      the chest while wearing armor that has 50 melee protection, the base protection
      is 50, then RNG can make the final protection be between 37.5 and 62.5 percent.
      The damage you'd take could range from 11.25 to 18.75, instead of 0, 15, or
      30.  Remember that some weapons can penetrate armor.
  - rscadd: Added personal communicators, a device that enables someone to talk to
      someone else at vast distances.  You can talk to people who are far from the
      station, so long as telecommunications remains operational.
  - rscadd: To use, become a ghost, then use the appropiate verb and pick a communicator
      to call.  Then you wait until someone picks up.  Once that occurs, you will
      be placed inside the communicator.  The voice you use is your currently loaded
      character.  Languages are supported as well.
  - tweak: Round-end is now three minutes instead of one, and counts down, to allow
      for some more post-round roleplay.  If the station blows up for whatever reason,
      the old one minute restart is retained.
  PsiOmegaDelta:
  - rscdel: Manual radio frequency changes can no longer go outside the standard frequency
      span.
  - rscadd: Users with sufficient access can instead select pre-defined channels outside

  Neerti:
  - rscadd: Suit cooling units can now be attached to voidsuits.  Note that coolers
      and air tanks are mutually exclusive.

      maximum potential charge, to ensure two blasts do not completely disable a synthetic.

  - tweak: EMP hitting a cyborg will no longer outright stun them.  Instead, they

      and such to use their internal access, so long as the person using them does
      not have an ID card equipped.

      event now involves a power spike originating from the engine, which the grid

  Mechoid:
  - rscadd: Adds more interactions with animals, like shearing and taming.

      PSUs now support multiple power cells and hot-swapping of cells during operation.
      This allows for either charging multiple cells at once in one device (directly

      kW or MW accordingly)
