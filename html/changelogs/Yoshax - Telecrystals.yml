# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, all entries are changed into a single [] after a master changelog generation. Just remove the brackets when you add new entries.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("), as certain characters otherwise screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes: 
  - rscadd: "Attacking yourself, or anyone else with a stack of five or more telecrystals will teleport the attacked person to a random, safe (not in space) location within 14 metres."
  - tweak: "All telecrystals ammounts have been multiplied by 10. This means the base amount is now 120, and an emag for example costs 30, vs the previous 12 and 3, respectively."
  - tweak: "You can once again use telecrystals on an emag to add more uses to it. You get 1 use per every 2 telecrystals."
  - tweak: "Instead of only being able to remove 1 telecrystal from your uplink, you can now remove 1, 5, 10, 25, 50."
