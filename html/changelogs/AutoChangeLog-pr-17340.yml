changes:
  - rscdel: "missing every other shot you made against mobs"
  - rscadd: "hitting every shot you make against mobs"
  - bugfix: "Evasion now properly is calculated and doesn't have a 30% chance of being nullified."
  - bugfix: "Scoped weapons now have their accuracy stat properly applied."
  - balance: "Bad Shot/Eagle Eye work by increasing/decreasing the target's evasion. Only applies if the target HAS evasion in the first place."
  - balance: "Evasion now works in PvP melee. (Blue-Grabbing or making a high evasion target prone nullifies their evasion)"
  - balance: "Mobs now have chances to randomize/miss the zone they were shooting for on Player Characters"
  - balance: "Point blank shots will still always 100% hit Player Characters no matter your evasion. Just a reminder!"
