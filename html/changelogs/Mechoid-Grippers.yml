  - rscadd: "Research and Engineering borgs now have 'Circuit Grippers', used for constructing and operating integrated circuit machinery."

  - tweak: "Grippers now show their held item's examine information when examined. Tab information added."
  - tweak: "Cyborgs can now interact with integrated circuit printers and machines when adjacent to them."
  - tweak: "Multitools now have a menu to switch modes between standard use and integrated circuit reference scanning. Antag multi-tools untouched for now."
