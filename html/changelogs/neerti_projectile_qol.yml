changes: 
  - rscadd: "Most Non-hitscan projectiles now have a pixel-perfect visual effect when they impact something, or when they expire from moving too far without hitting anything."
  - soundadd: "Projectiles can now have sounds for when they hit someone. They can also have a different sound when they hit something solid like a wall."
  - soundadd: "A sound is now played when a projectile 'narrowly misses' someone."
  - rsctweak: "Getting hit with a projectile is now more noticible in the chat log, with bigger text. Only the person who got hit will see the bigger text."
