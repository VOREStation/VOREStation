changes:
  - qol: "Heavily reworks human movement code, making things such as halloss affected by species pain tolerance, making injury slowdown based on health % instead of a hardcoded 40 damage, making traumatic shock gradually apply slowdown instead of all at once."
  - qol: "Removes 5 slowdown penalty when using AIM MODE"
  - bugfix: "force_max_speed will now properly apply the HUMAN MAX SPEED instead of allowing things to slow you down."
  - bugfix: "Modifiers with haste now apply HUMAN MAX SPEED instead of allowing things to slow you down."
  - code_imp: "Makes Unusual Movement a TRAIT() instead of a species var."
  - balance: "Oxycodone now fully ignores slowdown from halloss and injury. (It still applies 1 slowdown and multiplies all slowdown you're taking by 1.25x however)"
  - balance: "The max slowdown from injury / halloss is now 4."
  - bugfix: "pain_mod now affects pain."
