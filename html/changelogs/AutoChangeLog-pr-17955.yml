changes:
  - rscadd: "Reagent refinery machines"
  - rscadd: "Gas cracks for fracking that should be made into pois for caves. Deep drills make them produce gas, fluid pumps get reagents."
  - rscadd: "Re-enabled old ores for future use with the refinery"
  - rscadd: "'Metallic' shades of paint using titanium dioxide"
  - rscadd: "distillation reactions for making ink, to turn into paint"
  - rscadd: "various distillation reactions for reagents previously inaccessible, or only obtainable through other means"
  - rscadd: "various \"condensing\" distillation reactions that turn atmo gas into reagents using frost oil"
  - refactor: "Distillation reactions are now required to be done under specific atmospheres. The original distillation reactions can be done under normal atmosphere."
  - bugfix: "add missing fluid pump research"
  - code_imp: "Extended unit-test for reagents to respect new distillation"
