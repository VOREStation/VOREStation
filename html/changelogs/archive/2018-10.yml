  Anewbe:
  - bugfix: You can no longer have ALL of your blood punched out.
  - bugfix: Haemophiliacs will no longer spontaneously have ALL of their blood go
      missing from ~90%.
  - rscadd: Emitters can be locked while off, too.
  - rscadd: Graves are now a thing in the code, will need some testing and probably
      more work before they get more common.
  Mechoid:
  - rscadd: Added a RIG customization kit.
  - tweak: RIGs now use a var called suit_state to determine the basis for their component
      icons, rather than the rig's icon state.
