  Heroman3003:
  - bugfix: A thin sheet of lead properly defeats radiation once more, but steel beams
      remain permeable.
  TheFurryFeline:
  - bugfix: Name and desc vars switched for changeling combat boots so removal of
      item doesn't output an excessively long name.
  - bugfix: Fixes light frames returning 5 steel per deconstruction when 2 steel is
      used to create the frame.
  schnayy:
  - rscadd: Added the Pyralis borg sprites.
