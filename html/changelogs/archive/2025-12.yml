  - rscadd: fusion coils can explode if shot by damaging guns; one hit is fine, two
      will make them detonate. damaged coils have their charge cap halved. unstable
      coils can still be safely discharged, which will also mean they won't explode
      if hit again.
  - qol: fusion coils glow in the dark to make them easier to find
  - balance: fusion coils are heavier and incur more slowdown
