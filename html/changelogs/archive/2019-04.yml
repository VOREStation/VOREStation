  Anewbe:
  - rscadd: The Subspace Jammer traitor item now lasts about 10 minutes. It now blocks
      signalers from sending or receiving, and also obscures suit sensors around it.
  N3X15 (MistyLuminescence):
  - tweak: Departmental winter coats can now hold the same items as their standard
      departmental suit items - labcoats, hazard vests, body armor, aprons, etc.
  Neerti:
  - tweak: Removes ability for AI to print and inhabit maintenance and construction
      drones. This has been replaced with a system which allows for AIs to inhabit
      special cyborg shells, called AI Shells, which are built with a new MMI type
      in Robotics. Most of the regular cyborg mechanics applies to AI Shells.
  Novacat:
  - rscadd: Adds new status displays for all alert levels
  - rscadd: Adds yellow, violet, and orange alert levels
  - rscadd: Added Stasis Cages, which allows safe transport of mobs.

      easier rearranging of characters, or wiping characters by copying empty slots.

  Woodrat:
  - tweak: Arrivals dock should not stay locked shut
  - bugfix: Two windoors in xenobio stationside lacking access requirements
  mistyLuminescence:
  - rscadd: Lays the foundation for RIGs to be worn on the belt slot. Doesn't apply
      to any RIGs currently, unless VV'd, but stay tuned!
  - tweak: Large autoinjectors are now scannable and syringeable again, just like
      they used to be. Unidentified autoinjectors still aren't, unless you ID them
      first.
  - rscadd: Adds beakers to the hydroponics lockers and NutriMax vendors.
  - tweak: More jobs can now take certain items in the loadout.
  - rscadd: Adds departmental turtlenecks, available in department wardrobes or the
      loadout selection. Look good... in space.

  Heroman3003:
  - rscadd: Allows voidsuits to have parts attached and removed while held in hand
      (but still not when worn).
  - tweak: Syringes will now immediately inject 5 units per injection into reagent
      containers. Does not change how injecting mobs work
  - tweak: Tape rolls can now be used on tiles with directional windows as long as
      they don't directly obstruct them.
  Mechoid:
  - rscadd: Reagents can now have a list of organs specified to slow their processing.
  - rscadd: Reagents now process in the bloodstream at a rate determined by current
      pulse. No pulse, for any reason, will cause slightly slower processing if your
      species has a heart.
  - rscadd: The heart organ determines the 'standard pulse' if the species has one.
  - rscadd: Modifiers can set pulse directly, or shift it.
  - rscadd: Adds Robobags and Corp-Tags to Robotics.
  - rscadd: Re-adds the Space Worm with New and Improved [Doesn't Break The Universe]
      logic.

      or not.

      to move slower or faster in specific directions.
  - rscadd: Weather application in the communicator displays wind direction and severity.
  - rscdel: Holding umbrellas while in a storm no longer stuns you.
  chaoko99:
  - rscadd: Ore bags will automatically pick up items when held, belted, or pocketed,
      and automatically deposit ore in boxes if one is being pulled.
