      the gas within the pipeline. This occurred when you placed a new pipe on a pipeline

      in the pipes on the pipeline not saving the gas, resulting in all the gas within
      the pipes on that pipeline being voided.

      painpills and medications to help stabilize you to get you to medical before
      you croak.

      of just a random 'you feel itchy' so players are less blindsided by infections.

  - bugfix: Crayons and markers get properly added to your stomach

  - refactor: a sheet's coin type is now set on the stack obj definition, tidied up
      the mint code to not be a string of if/else if, and to not require a list of
      valid materials on the machine, so now it's easier to add new coin types. coin
      names also use material def names now.

      later'
  - spellcheck: myelamine has an updated description, informing you that it doesn't
      heal JUST internal wounds, but it also heals external wounds.
  - spellcheck: myelamine now accurately tells you via the chemmaster that it clots
      MORE than just internal hemorrhages. It additionally tells you the ideal dose
      for wound healing.

      disarm-intenting them (This was never made clear that disarm intent makes them
      speak.)
  - code_imp: Gets rid of a few non-existent base paths by converting one of the paths
      into the base one. (plushy/therapy & plushies/squid)
  - bugfix: Fixes the toaster from having the sus plushie sound.
  - code_imp: Changed some timers that were calling a proc that just set a var to
