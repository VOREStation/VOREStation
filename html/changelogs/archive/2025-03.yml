      in the pipes on the pipeline not saving the gas, resulting in all the gas within
      the pipes on that pipeline being voided.

      painpills and medications to help stabilize you to get you to medical before
      you croak.

      second. You now have gradually accumulate damage over time. Get those internals

  - refactor: a sheet's coin type is now set on the stack obj definition, tidied up
      the mint code to not be a string of if/else if, and to not require a list of

      names also use material def names now.
