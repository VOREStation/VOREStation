  Anewbe:
  - bugfix: Vedahq is now properly locked behind a whitelist.
  - tweak: Headgibbing is now determined by config
  - tweak: Promethean regeneration has been toned down. It will no longer provide
      healing if the Promethean is wet, too hungry, too hot, or too cold.
  - tweak: Prometheans are no longer shock resistant. It should now be more possible
      to catch them alive.
  - tweak: Promethean body temperature is now the default room temperature. They also
      hit cold_level_2 at a higher temperature.
  Atermonera:
  - bugfix: Rigsuits have been resupplied following a mass-recall after a number of
      suits were reported to have defective pressure-sealant mechanisms. The new sealant
      mechanisms have been thoroughly tested and should be less prone to failure.
  Mechoid:
  - tweak: Tweaked Respiro- Cordra- Gastiro- and Hepanephro- Daxons to be more effective
      with dealing with the side-effects of damaged organs.
  kartagrafi:
  - rscadd: 'Adds several clothing items to loadout such as: Nock masks, cowls and
      robes.'
