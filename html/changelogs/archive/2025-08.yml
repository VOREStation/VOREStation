      base sprites using "Custom Species Icon" in character setup. The now default
      light furred sprite is very lightly shaded and mostly white, allowing it to
      be easily customised for light coloured characters. The dark furred zorren option
      is same as the old base sprite for those that want to preserve their original
      sprites and shading. Thank you to tt2 for helping get this to work.
