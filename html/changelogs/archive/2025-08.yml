  Cameron-The-Raven:
  - sound: Point Defense Turrets now make sounds when they fire
  - rscadd: Point Defense Turrets now have a new effect when they fire
  - qol: Point defense turrets now only pull energy from the turret matrix.
  - balance: Point defense turrets now turn slower. They can still hit meteors just
      fine. Upgrading the turrets is also now more worthwhile!
  - maptweak: Mappers no longer need to have cables running out to point turrets
  - bugfix: fixes a bug where turrets could not be adjusted if they were in an unpowered
      area
  - bugfix: Science can now make mop tech

  SatinIsle:
  - qol: Added the ability to use "Transfer Liquids (Vore)" with prey inside of your
      bellies.
  - rscadd: Added ethanol as an option for liquid belly reagents.
  - bugfix: Fixed medical issues not proccing for species that can't be infected.
  - bugfix: Fixed medical issues so that they can be cured by ingested reagents too.
  - qol: Zorren now have the option to switch between light furred and dark furred
      base sprites using "Custom Species Icon" in character setup. The now default
      light furred sprite is very lightly shaded and mostly white, allowing it to
      be easily customised for light coloured characters. The dark furred zorren option
      is same as the old base sprite for those that want to preserve their original
      sprites and shading. Thank you to tt2 for helping get this to work.
  Will:
  - rscadd: Reagent refinery machines
  - rscadd: Gas cracks for fracking that should be made into pois for caves. Deep

      The original distillation reactions can be done under normal atmosphere.
  - bugfix: add missing fluid pump research
  - code_imp: Extended unit-test for reagents to respect new distillation

  SatinIsle:

      to one player at a time.
