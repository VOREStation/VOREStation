  ShadowLarkens:
  - image: Made the body scanner actually show an outline of the person inside it.

  ShadowLarkens:
  - bugfix: loadout system not working until you switch back and forth
  Willburd:
  - code_imp: weak_reference added to blacklisted copyvars

  Cameron-The-Raven:
  - sound: Point Defense Turrets now make sounds when they fire
  - rscadd: Point Defense Turrets now have a new effect when they fire
  - qol: Point defense turrets now only pull energy from the turret matrix.
  - balance: Point defense turrets now turn slower. They can still hit meteors just
      fine. Upgrading the turrets is also now more worthwhile!
  - maptweak: Mappers no longer need to have cables running out to point turrets
  - bugfix: fixes a bug where turrets could not be adjusted if they were in an unpowered
      area
  - bugfix: Science can now make mop tech
  Kashargul:
  - code_imp: tgui-core 5.0.0
  - bugfix: admin ticket replies not being relayed to the chat
  Reagent Refinery Project:
  - qol: Gas refinery now uses coolant instead of frost oil.
  SatinIsle:
  - qol: Added the ability to use "Transfer Liquids (Vore)" with prey inside of your
      bellies.
  - rscadd: Added ethanol as an option for liquid belly reagents.
  - bugfix: Fixed medical issues not proccing for species that can't be infected.
  - bugfix: Fixed medical issues so that they can be cured by ingested reagents too.
  - qol: Zorren now have the option to switch between light furred and dark furred
      base sprites using "Custom Species Icon" in character setup. The now default
      light furred sprite is very lightly shaded and mostly white, allowing it to
      be easily customised for light coloured characters. The dark furred zorren option
      is same as the old base sprite for those that want to preserve their original
      sprites and shading. Thank you to tt2 for helping get this to work.
  Will:
  - rscadd: Reagent refinery machines
  - rscadd: Gas cracks for fracking that should be made into pois for caves. Deep
      drills make them produce gas, fluid pumps get reagents.
  - rscadd: Re-enabled old ores for future use with the refinery
  - rscadd: '''Metallic'' shades of paint using titanium dioxide'
  - rscadd: distillation reactions for making ink, to turn into paint
  - rscadd: various distillation reactions for reagents previously inaccessible, or
      only obtainable through other means
  - rscadd: various "condensing" distillation reactions that turn atmo gas into reagents
      using frost oil
  - refactor: Distillation reactions are now required to be done under specific atmospheres.
      The original distillation reactions can be done under normal atmosphere.
  - bugfix: add missing fluid pump research
  - code_imp: Extended unit-test for reagents to respect new distillation
