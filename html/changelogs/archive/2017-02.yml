  Anewbe:
  - rscadd: Fake command reports now make the paper show up.
  - bugfix: Mining cameras should work now.
  MagmaRam:
  - tweak: There is now a short delay before being able to fire when using hostage-taking
      mode, and a short delay between shots. This should make hostage mode useful
      for taking hostages and ambushes, rather than as an aimbot in actual firefights.
  - bugfix: Sandwiches at max size can be eaten with a fork.
  Yosh:
  - rscadd: Some vending machines now log the items they've vended and had stocked,
      storing the name of the user, the time and the item. These can be found by using
      the new verb for vending machines, or from the right click menu.
  Zuhayr:
  - rscadd: Adminhelps now have a TAKE button that allow an admin to claim it, and
      inform the adminhelper that someone is on the case.
