			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Adds NanoUI for communicators, the ability for communicators to call other communicators on the station, the ability for station-bound people to call ghosts, and for ghosts to toggle their visibility to communicators on or off in character preferences (defaults to off).  Communicators can now also support more than one call at the same time, for both ghosts and normal communicators.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds new machine to telecomms, the Exonet node.  It is very basic in terms of functionality, but certain services can be selectively disabled from it, such as newscaster updates, communicators, or external PDA messages.  Adds methods for building and deconstructing Exonet nodes.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Adds framework for a fake-networking system called EPv2 that communicators will now use, and perhaps other machines will in the future, for good or for evil.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Changeling Spacearmor reduced in protective ability.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Cryogenic String and Delayed Toxic Sting now have a three minute cooldown upon stinging someone.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Cryotoxin, the chemical used in Cryogenic String, is 25% less potent now.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The rune to summon Narsie has been changed.  Narsie is no longer summoned, but Hell still comes.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Spooky mobs spawned from spooky portals as a result of Hell coming have had their speed, health, and damage reduced.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Manifested humans no longer count for summoning Hell.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Changes how armor calculations work.  All the armor values remain the same, but the 'two dice rolls' system has been replaced with a mix of reliable damage reduction and a bit of RNG to keep things interesting.  The intention is to make weaker armor more relevent and stronger armor less overpowered.</li>
				<li class="tweak">When you are hit, it uses the armor protection as a base amount to protect you from, then it does a roll between +25% and -25% of that base protection, and adds it to the base protection. The result of that is how much damage is reduced from the attack.  For example, if you are hit by an energy sword in the chest while wearing armor that has 50 melee protection, the base protection is 50, then RNG can make the final protection be between 37.5 and 62.5 percent. The damage you'd take could range from 11.25 to 18.75, instead of 0, 15, or 30.  Remember that some weapons can penetrate armor.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added personal communicators, a device that enables someone to talk to someone else at vast distances.  You can talk to people who are far from the station, so long as telecommunications remains operational.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">To use, become a ghost, then use the appropiate verb and pick a communicator to call.  Then you wait until someone picks up.  Once that occurs, you will be placed inside the communicator.  The voice you use is your currently loaded character.  Languages are supported as well.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Round-end is now three minutes instead of one, and counts down, to allow for some more post-round roleplay.  If the station blows up for whatever reason, the old one minute restart is retained.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Good news to the roboticists! The long waited firmware update for the bots has arrived. You can expect the following changes:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Medbots have improved the disease detection algorithms.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Floorbot firmware has been bugtested. In particular, they will no longer get stuck near the windows, hopelessly trying to fix the floor under the glass.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Floorbots have also received an internal low-power metal synthesizer. They will use it to make their own tiles. Slowly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Following the complains from humanitarian organizations regarding securitron brutality, stength of their stunners has been toned down. They will also politely demand that you get on the floor before arresting you. Except for the taser-mounted guys, they will still tase you down.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Other minor fixes.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The lasertag bots are now forbidden to build and use following the incident #1526672. Please don't let it happen again.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The farmbot design has been finished! Made from a watertank, robot arm, plant analyzer, bucket, minihoe and a proximity sensor, these small (not really) bots will be a useful companion to any gardener and/or xenobotanist.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Spider learning alert: they have learned to recognize the bots and will mercilessly attack them.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">An experimental CPU upgrade would theoretically allow any of the bots to function with the same intelligence capacity as the maintenance drones. We still have no idea what causes it to boot up. Science!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">INCOMING TRANSMISSION: Greetings to agents, pirates, operatives, and anyone who otherwise uses our equipment. Following the NT update of bot firmware, we have updated the cryptographic sequencer's hacking routines as well. The medbots you emag will not poison you anymore, the clanbots won't clean after themselves immediately, and floorbots... wear a space suit. Oh, and it works on the new farmbots, too.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Adds NanoUI for communicators, the ability for communicators to call other communicators on the station, the ability for station-bound people to call ghosts, and for ghosts to toggle their visibility to communicators on or off in character preferences (defaults to off).  Communicators can now also support more than one call at the same time, for both ghosts and normal communicators.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds new machine to telecomms, the Exonet node.  It is very basic in terms of functionality, but certain services can be selectively disabled from it, such as newscaster updates, communicators, or external PDA messages.  Adds methods for building and deconstructing Exonet nodes.</li>

				<li class="rscdel">Spooky mobs spawned from spooky portals as a result of Hell coming have had their speed, health, and damage reduced.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Manifested humans no longer count for summoning Hell.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Changes how armor calculations work.  All the armor values remain the same, but the 'two dice rolls' system has been replaced with a mix of reliable damage reduction and a bit of RNG to keep things interesting.  The intention is to make weaker armor more relevent and stronger armor less overpowered.</li>
				<li class="tweak">When you are hit, it uses the armor protection as a base amount to protect you from, then it does a roll between +25% and -25% of that base protection, and adds it to the base protection. The result of that is how much damage is reduced from the attack.  For example, if you are hit by an energy sword in the chest while wearing armor that has 50 melee protection, the base protection is 50, then RNG can make the final protection be between 37.5 and 62.5 percent. The damage you'd take could range from 11.25 to 18.75, instead of 0, 15, or 30.  Remember that some weapons can penetrate armor.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added personal communicators, a device that enables someone to talk to someone else at vast distances.  You can talk to people who are far from the station, so long as telecommunications remains operational.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">To use, become a ghost, then use the appropiate verb and pick a communicator to call.  Then you wait until someone picks up.  Once that occurs, you will be placed inside the communicator.  The voice you use is your currently loaded character.  Languages are supported as well.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Round-end is now three minutes instead of one, and counts down, to allow for some more post-round roleplay.  If the station blows up for whatever reason, the old one minute restart is retained.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Floorbot firmware has been bugtested. In particular, they will no longer get stuck near the windows, hopelessly trying to fix the floor under the glass.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Floorbots have also received an internal low-power metal synthesizer. They will use it to make their own tiles. Slowly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Following the complains from humanitarian organizations regarding securitron brutality, stength of their stunners has been toned down. They will also politely demand that you get on the floor before arresting you. Except for the taser-mounted guys, they will still tase you down.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Other minor fixes.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The lasertag bots are now forbidden to build and use following the incident #1526672. Please don't let it happen again.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The farmbot design has been finished! Made from a watertank, robot arm, plant analyzer, bucket, minihoe and a proximity sensor, these small (not really) bots will be a useful companion to any gardener and/or xenobotanist.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Spider learning alert: they have learned to recognize the bots and will mercilessly attack them.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">An experimental CPU upgrade would theoretically allow any of the bots to function with the same intelligence capacity as the maintenance drones. We still have no idea what causes it to boot up. Science!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">INCOMING TRANSMISSION: Greetings to agents, pirates, operatives, and anyone who otherwise uses our equipment. Following the NT update of bot firmware, we have updated the cryptographic sequencer's hacking routines as well. The medbots you emag will not poison you anymore, the clanbots won't clean after themselves immediately, and floorbots... wear a space suit. Oh, and it works on the new farmbots, too.</li>
