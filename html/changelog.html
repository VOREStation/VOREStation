Communicators can now also support more than one call at the same time, for both ghosts and normal communicators.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds new machine to telecomms, the Exonet node.

				<li class="rscdel">Manifested humans no longer count for summoning Hell.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Changes how armor calculations work.  All the armor values remain the same, but the 'two dice rolls' system has been replaced with a mix of reliable damage reduction and a bit of RNG to keep things interesting.  The intention is to make weaker armor more relevent and stronger armor less overpowered.</li>
				<li class="tweak">When you are hit, it uses the armor protection as a base amount to protect you from, then it does a roll between +25% and -25% of that base protection, and adds it to the base protection. The result of that is how much damage is reduced from the attack.  For example, if you are hit by an energy sword in the chest while wearing armor that has 50 melee protection, the base protection is 50, then RNG can make the final protection be between 37.5 and 62.5 percent. The damage you'd take could range from 11.25 to 18.75, instead of 0, 15, or 30.  Remember that some weapons can penetrate armor.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added personal communicators, a device that enables someone to talk to someone else at vast distances.  You can talk to people who are far from the station, so long as telecommunications remains operational.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">To use, become a ghost, then use the appropiate verb and pick a communicator to call.  Then you wait until someone picks up.  Once that occurs, you will be placed inside the communicator.  The voice you use is your currently loaded character.  Languages are supported as well.</li>
