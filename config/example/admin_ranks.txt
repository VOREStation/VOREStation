#Admin Rank format is as follows:
#
#Name = Game Admin
#Include = @ ADMIN BAN SOUND
#Exclude = FUN
#Edit =
#
#Name will match anything after '=' and must be identical to an admin's rank in admins.txt to be linked but otherwise has no formatting restrictions.
#A rank's permissions are defined with keywords that control access to groups of verbs and abilities, they are case-sensitive and separated by a space with no prefix.
#To define no permissions for a type, leave it empty.
#There are three types of permissions:
#Include will give a keyword to a rank.
#Exclude removes a keyword and takes precedence over Include.
#Edit will allow an admin to edit these permissions on other ranks or change an admin's rank to another if they can edit all the permissions it has.
#Edit is only used when SQL-based admin loading is enabled.
#If SQL-based admin loading is enabled, ranks and their keywords listed here will be loaded first and override any with the same name loaded from the database.
#
#The following are valid permission keywords:
#ADMIN = general admin tools, verbs etc.
#FUN = events, other event-orientated actions. Access to the fun secrets in the secrets panel.
#BAN = the ability to ban and unban.
#STEALTH = the ability to stealthmin (make yourself appear with a fake name to everyone but other admins).
#POSSESS = the ability to possess objects.
#REJUVINATE = the ability to heal, respawn, modify damage and use godmode
#BUILD = the ability to use buildmode.
#SERVER = the ability to restart the server, change the game mode or force a round to start/end.
#DEBUG = debug tools used for diagnosing and fixing problems. It's useful to give this to coders so they can investigate problems on a live server.
#VAREDIT = everyone may view viewvars/debugvars/whatever you call it. This keyword allows you to actually EDIT those variables.
#PERMISSIONS = allows you to promote and/or demote people.
#SOUND = allows you to upload and play SOUND.
#SPAWN = mob transformations, spawning of most atoms including mobs (high-risk atoms, e.g. blackholes, will require the +FUN flag too).
#EVENT = a group of verbs that make it possible to run an event, or other badminnery.
#EVERYTHING = Simply gives you everything without having to type every flag.
#@ = special keyword for the current permission type that adds all the keywords that the preceding rank has of the same type.
