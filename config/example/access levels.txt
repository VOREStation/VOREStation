HOW TO CONVERT A MAP TO THE NEW (june 2008) ACCESS LEVEL SYSTEM
1. Open the .dmp file up in Notepad
2. Find all the "access = blahblah" attributes of doors.
3. Delete them.
4. Open the map up in Dream Maker. If you didn't get them all, it'll tell you so.
5. Assign the existing doors new access permissions using the method below.

HOW TO MAKE A MAP USING THE NEW (june 2008) ACCESS LEVEL SYSTEM
1. Make a map as normal
2. Select a door that you want to not be accessible to everybody
3. Right click on it and edit its attributes
4. Make the "req_access_txt" attribute be a semicolon-separated list of the permissions required to open the doors
5. Repeat for all doors.

For example, a brig door would have it be "2" while a door that requires you have toxins and teleporter access (for whatever reason) would have it be "9;20"
