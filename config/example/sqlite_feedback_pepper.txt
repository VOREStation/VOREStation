# This is used to alter the hash for in-game feedback authors.
# The reason for this is that doing this stops admins trying to 
# guess who submitted a specific piece of feedback by feeding
# a list of ckeys into an MD5 hasher.
# In order for this to work, this file must contain a string, to be 
# added onto the ckey before hashing, and ideally as few people as 
# possible should know the string. It is also recommended to utilize 
# file permissions (e.g. chown) to only allow the game to access 
# this file, and forbid people with access to the server directly 
# from just opening the file (even if they use sudo, it'll make a log).
# Make sure the string doesn't start with a #, or it'll be commented out.
