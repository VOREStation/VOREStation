## -SQLite Options-
## Uncomment to enable the use of SQLite. This does nothing by itself but other features that require SQLite will need this to be on.
## This can safely run alongside a MySQL/MariaDB database if they are powering seperate features.
# SQLITE_ENABLED

## Uncomment to enable a SQLite-powered in-game feedback system.
## SQLite must be enabled for this to function.
## It offers a means for players to be able to give feedback about the server.
## The benefit of doing so in-game is that the quality of feedback received will likely be superior, as it self-selects for people who care enough to join the game.
# SQLITE_FEEDBACK

## A list of 'topics' that can be used to categorize feedback submitted, chosen
## by the user. Have each topic seperated by a ';', as seen below.
## The first one in the list will be the default one used, if the user does not change it.
# SQLITE_FEEDBACK_TOPICS General; Suggestion; Complaint

## Uncomment to add a layer of privacy to player feedback, by hashing their key, if the user wants to.
## This is intended to encourage more honest feedback, while still allowing the ability to determine
## if its just one person submitting everything.
## A 'pepper.txt' containing a secret string must exist in the /config folder.
## If this is turned off, users won't have the option to obfuscate their key.
## Note that changing this does not retroactively change past submissions.
# SQLITE_FEEDBACK_PRIVACY

## Determines the 'cooldown' inbetween submissions, in days.
## This is recommended if privacy is active, to prevent spam floods.
## Less needed if feedback is not anonymous, since you can just ban spammers.
## Setting to zero means no rate limiting.
SQLITE_FEEDBACK_COOLDOWN 0

## Determines if feedback should be restricted based on how recently someone first joined.
## This is very unreliable due to how the age system works in general, but it might still be helpful.
## Set this to how many days you want someone to have to wait when they first join.
## Setting to zero will disable this restriction.
SQLITE_FEEDBACK_MIN_AGE 7
