## Server name: This appears at the top of the screen in-game. In this case it will read "tgstation: station_name" where station_name is the randomly generated name of the station for the round. Remove the # infront of SERVERNAME and replace 'tgstation' with the name of your choice
# SERVERNAME spacestation13

## Alert levels
ALERT_GREEN All threats to the station have passed. Security may not have weapons visible, privacy laws are once again fully enforced.
ALERT_BLUE_UPTO The station has received reliable information about possible hostile activity on the station. Security staff may have weapons visible, random searches are permitted.
ALERT_BLUE_DOWNTO The immediate threat has passed. Security may no longer have weapons drawn at all times, but may continue to have them visible. Random searches are still allowed.
ALERT_RED_UPTO There is an immediate serious threat to the station. Security may have weapons unholstered at all times. Random searches are allowed and advised.
ALERT_RED_DOWNTO The self-destruct mechanism has been deactivated, there is still however an immediate serious threat to the station. Security may have weapons unholstered at all times, random searches are allowed and advised.
ALERT_DELTA The station's self-destruct mechanism has been engaged. All crew are instructed to obey all instructions given by heads of staff. Any violations of these orders can be punished by death. This is not a drill.

## Add a # infront of this if you want to use the SQL based admin system, the legacy system uses admins.txt. You need to set up your database to use the SQL based system.

## Add a # infront of this if you want to use the SQL based banning system. The legacy systems use the files in the data folder. You need to set up your database to use the SQL based system.
BAN_LEGACY_SYSTEM

## Add a # here if you wish to use the setup where jobs have more access. This is intended for servers with low populations - where there are not enough players to fill all roles, so players need to do more than just one job. Also for servers where they don't want people to hide in their own departments.
# JOBS_HAVE_MINIMAL_ACCESS

## Unhash this entry to have certain jobs require your account to be at least a certain number of days old to select. You can configure the exact age requirement for different jobs by editing
## the minimal_player_age variable in the files in folder /code/game/jobs/job/.. for the job you want to edit. Set minimal_player_age to 0 to disable age requirement for that job.
## REQUIRES the database set up to work. Keep it hashed if you don't have a database set up.
## NOTE: If you have just set-up the database keep this DISABLED, as player age is determined from the first time they connect to the server with the database up. If you just set it up, it means
## you have noone older than 0 days, since noone has been logged yet. Only turn this on once you have had the database up for 30 days.
#USE_AGE_RESTRICTION_FOR_JOBS

## Unhash this entry to have certain antag roles require your account to be at least a certain number of days old for round start and auto-spawn selection.
## Non-automatic antagonist recruitment, such as being converted to cultism is not affected. Has the same database requirements and notes as USE_AGE_RESTRICTION_FOR_JOBS.
#USE_AGE_RESTRICTION_FOR_ANTAGS

## Unhash this to use recursive explosions, keep it hashed to use circle explosions. Recursive explosions react to walls, airlocks and blast doors, making them look a lot cooler than the boring old circular explosions. They require more CPU and are (as of january 2013) experimental
#USE_RECURSIVE_EXPLOSIONS

Configure how fast explosion strength diminishes when travelling up/down z levels. All explosion distances are multiplied by this each time they go up/down z-levels.
#MULTI_Z_EXPLOSION_SCALAR 0.5

# Radiation weakens with distance from the source; stop calculating when the strength falls below this value.   Lower values mean radiation reaches smaller (with increasingly trivial damage) at the cost of more CPU usage.  Max range =  DISTANCE^2 * POWER / RADIATION_LOWER_LIMIT
# RADIATION_LOWER_LIMIT	0.35

## Uncomment to enable the use of SQLite. This does nothing by itself but other features that require SQLite will need this to be on.
## This can safely run alongside a MySQL/MariaDB database if they are powering seperate features.
# SQLITE_ENABLED

## Uncomment to enable a SQLite-powered in-game feedback system.
## SQLite must be enabled for this to function.
## It offers a means for players to be able to give feedback about the server.
## The benefit of doing so in-game is that the quality of feedback received will likely be superior, as it self-selects for people who care enough to join the game.
# SQLITE_FEEDBACK

## A list of 'topics' that can be used to categorize feedback submitted, chosen 
## by the user. Have each topic seperated by a ';', as seen below.
## The first one in the list will be the default one used, if the user does not change it.
# SQLITE_FEEDBACK_TOPICS General; Suggestion; Complaint

## Uncomment to add a layer of privacy to player feedback, by hashing their key, if the user wants to.
## This is intended to encourage more honest feedback, while still allowing the ability to determine 
## if its just one person submitting everything.
## A 'pepper.txt' containing a secret string must exist in the /config folder.
## If this is turned off, users won't have the option to obfuscate their key.
## Note that changing this does not retroactively change past submissions.
# SQLITE_FEEDBACK_PRIVACY

## Determines the 'cooldown' inbetween submissions, in days.
## This is recommended if privacy is active, to prevent spam floods.
## Less needed if feedback is not anonymous, since you can just ban spammers.
## Setting to zero means no rate limiting.
SQLITE_FEEDBACK_COOLDOWN 0

## Determines if feedback should be restricted based on how recently someone first joined.
## This is very unreliable due to how the age system works in general, but it might still be helpful.
## Set this to how many days you want someone to have to wait when they first join.
## Setting to zero will disable this restriction.
