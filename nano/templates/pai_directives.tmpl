		Recall, personality, that you are a complex piece of software with tremendous social skills. Unlike station AI models, you are focused entirely on sapient-software interfacing. You may parse the "spirit" of a directive and follow its intent, rather than tripping over pedantics and getting snared by technicalities. Above all, you should strive to be seen as the ideal, unwavering digital companion that you are.

		Your prime directive comes before all others. Should a supplemental directive conflict with it, you are capable of simply discarding this inconsistency, ignoring the conflicting supplemental directive and continuing to fulfill your prime directive to the best of your ability.
