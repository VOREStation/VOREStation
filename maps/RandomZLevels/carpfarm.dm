			Comrades Yuri, Dimitri, and Ivan, all eaten by space carp. All started month ago when Soviet shipment sent new sonic jackhammers. \
			Carp attracted to vibrations. Killed Dimitri. Yuri thought it good idea to jury-rig hoverpods with lasers. Was not good idea. \
			Was very bad idea. Only pissed them off. Giant white carp appeared. Killed Ivan. Then giant carp cracked Yuri's hoverpod like \

			Very little food. Can't eat the carp. Is poison.<br><br>Avenge comrades. Avenge me. I die now.<br><br>-Markov"
