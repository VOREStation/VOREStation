Greetings, newbean mapper! \
 \
The intent of this file is to allow you to more easily be able to follow mapping standards and guidelines.

The following folders will be listed here. If thereâ€™s been an update and this readme.md is out of date, let a maintainer on your codebase know. For CHOMPStation, this is a staffdev/maintainer, for VOREStation, this is a maintainer, for Polaris, this is also the maintainer role.



* Additional folders TBD.
* Mapping Guides
    * This folder exists for newer contributors to physically pull examples from, for example; SMES Wiring.dmm would be for guidance on how to properly wire an SMES. This is not an exhaustive list, but should help the repeated/FAQ questions by allowing one to poke at it in a map editor.
* Public Event Templates
<<<<<<< HEAD
    * This folder exists to house templates available to the public. Bear in mind that Game Master staff will likely not house all event templates publicly for security + future events, but this should be updated once a map is done with or a GM leaves the team and wishes to leave their maps public for future use.
* Public Ship Templates
    * This folder exists for SHIP templates that do not normally go into the ships folder (For reference, this ship folder is maps/offmap_vr/om_ships, or overmap/ships). This is for example ships, or for EM-specific, public ships.
* Templates
    * This folder is specifically for pre-prepared, ready-to-place templates for things such as drop pods, small maps, etc, things GM-staff will use regularly that are not necessarily related to events.
