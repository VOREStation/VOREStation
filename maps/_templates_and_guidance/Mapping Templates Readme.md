Greetings, newbean mapper! \
 \
The intent of this file is to allow you to more easily be able to follow mapping standards and guidelines.

The following folders will be listed here. If there’s been an update and this readme.md is out of date, let a maintainer on your codebase know. For CHOMPStation, this is a staffdev/maintainer, for VOREStation, this is a maintainer, for Polaris, this is also the maintainer role.



* Additional folders TBD.
* Mapping Guides
    * This folder exists for newer contributors to physically pull examples from, for example; SMES Wiring.dmm would be for guidance on how to properly wire an SMES. This is not an exhaustive list, but should help the repeated/FAQ questions by allowing one to poke at it in a map editor.
* Public Event Templates
    * This folder exists to house templates available to the public. Bear in mind that Game Master staff will likely not house all event templates publicly for security + future events, but this should be updated once a map is done with or a GM leaves the team and wishes to leave their maps public for future use.
* Public Ship Templates
    * This folder exists for SHIP templates that do not normally go into the ships folder (For reference, this ship folder is maps/offmap_vr/om_ships, or overmap/ships). This is for example ships, or for EM-specific, public ships.
* Templates
    * This folder is specifically for pre-prepared, ready-to-place templates for things such as drop pods, small maps, etc, things GM-staff will use regularly that are not necessarily related to events.
