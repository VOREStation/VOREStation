	desc = "The Xenomorph XX121, better known just as Xenomorph, are an extraterrestrial, endoparasitoid species with multiple life cycles, possibly originating from the planet Proteus (also known as Xenomorph Prime), which orbits the star A6 454. One of the deadliest of all known alien species, these creatures need a host organism in order to reproduce. The appearance of the Xenomorph varies depending on its host. The Human phenotype is generally around 7-8 feet, and roughly 136.0 to 181.4 kilograms in weight, with a long, muscular tail and large, curved, oblong head. The Queen of this species is generally twice as large (they can grow even larger, some even up to 100 feet tall, and stronger if given time) and possesses superior speed, strength and intelligence. The term Xenomorph is derived from the Greek words xeno ('stranger', 'alien', and 'foreigner') and morphe ('form', 'shape'). There are no solid facts as to the origins of the Xenomorph species; instead, there are many assumptions which cannot be confirmed. Based on the limited information we have, the most commonly accepted hypothesis is that they are an artificially created species, although another hypothesis says that they evolved naturally on a planet much different than our own. The Xenomorph lives in a hive together with its queen. Amazingly, the blood and other bodily fluids of the Xenomorph are highly acidic. It is not yet understood how a creature of such biology can exist. The planet Proteus is also home to rare, red-hued Xenomorphs, who frequently fight their black-colored rivals. Some Xenomorphs are alleged to be able to cloak themselves to be invisible to the human eye, but this has not been confirmed by independent study.";

Instead, it is completely covered in thick armored plates which act as a barrier between the Samak's internal warmth and the cold environment. However, this is still not that efficient, so the Samak feed often to keep themselves warm. The Samak have six thick legs tipped with broad claws, and roughly aerodynamic bodies. They burrow underground, detecting prey through incredibly keen thermal detection. They pop up suddenly, grab their next meal, and return underground just as quickly. They prefer larger prey, such as the Baqara, Elu'a Eli, and Tajaran. Due to their voracious appetites and tendency to ruin mine shafts and infrastructure, they have been hunted almost to extinction, mainly by the Slavemasters. For the Tajaran, being able to kill a Samak singlehandedly (and without 'cheating', such as saturation bombing and the like) is an incredible feat, and any individual who pulls it off is lauded greatly.";

Instead, it is completely covered in thick armored plates which act as a barrier between the Samak's internal warmth and the cold environment. However, this is still not that efficient, so the Samak feed often to keep themselves warm. The Samak have six thick legs tipped with broad claws, and roughly aerodynamic bodies. They burrow underground, detecting prey through incredibly keen thermal detection. They pop up suddenly, grab their next meal, and return underground just as quickly. They prefer larger prey, such as the Baqara, Elu'a Eli, and Tajaran. Due to their voracious appetites and tendency to ruin mine shafts and infrastructure, they have been hunted almost to extinction, mainly by the Slavemasters. For the Tajaran, being able to kill a Samak singlehandedly (and without 'cheating', such as saturation bombing and the like) is an incredible feat, and any individual who pulls it off is lauded greatly.";

Rodents also presented a threat to the stores the ship carried, both as cargo and as food for sailors. Furthermore, rats and mice were also sources of disease, which was dangerous for ships at sea for long periods of time. As Humanity thrust its self into the age of slipspace, the Cat has again made the common spaceship its hunting ground for exactly the same reasons it had in times of old. Skrell scientists have noted how the common Cat has been able to tame and even control Humans. It is believed that had the cat ever achieved sentience, Humanity its self would fall to its knees before their feline overlords.

Historically, the Pembroke has been attributed to the influx of dogs alongside Flemish weavers from around the 10th century, while the Cardigan is attributed to the dogs brought with Norse settlers, in particular a common ancestor of the Swedish Vallhund. A certain degree of inbreeding between the two types has been suggested to explain the similarities between the two. Here it is seen in a replica of its natural habitat, the common office building, where it participates in a symbiotic relationship with the Humans who also reside here.

When a suitable prey disturbs the mimic, it attacks, and if possible, swallows its victim whole. Scientists do not know how the creature reproduces, as all efforts to study the organism, dead or alive, have revealed that specimens examined do not have reproductive organs at all!

	desc = "The Xenomorph XX121, better known just as Xenomorph, are an extraterrestrial, endoparasitoid species with multiple life cycles, possibly originating from the planet Proteus (also known as Xenomorph Prime), which orbits the star A6 454. One of the deadliest of all known alien species, these creatures need a host organism in order to reproduce. The appearance of the Xenomorph varies depending on its host. The Human phenotype is generally around 7-8 feet, and roughly 136.0 to 181.4 kilograms in weight, with a long, muscular tail and large, curved, oblong head. The Queen of this species is generally twice as large (they can grow even larger, some even up to 100 feet tall, and stronger if given time) and possesses superior speed, strength and intelligence. The term Xenomorph is derived from the Greek words xeno ('stranger', 'alien', and 'foreigner') and morphe ('form', 'shape'). There are no solid facts as to the origins of the Xenomorph species; instead, there are many assumptions which cannot be confirmed. Based on the limited information we have, the most commonly accepted hypothesis is that they are an artificially created species, although another hypothesis says that they evolved naturally on a planet much different than our own. The Xenomorph lives in a hive together with its queen. Amazingly, the blood and other bodily fluids of the Xenomorph are highly acidic. It is not yet understood how a creature of such biology can exist. The planet Proteus is also home to rare, red-hued Xenomorphs, who frequently fight their black-colored rivals. Some Xenomorphs are alleged to be able to cloak themselves to be invisible to the human eye, but this has not been confirmed by independent study.";
