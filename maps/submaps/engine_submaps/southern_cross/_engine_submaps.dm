// This causes engine maps to get 'checked' and compiled, when undergoing a unit test.
// This is so Travis can validate PoIs, and ensure future changes don't break PoIs, as PoIs are loaded at runtime and the compiler can't catch errors.
// When adding a new engine, please add it to this list.
// Polaris: R-UST and Singulo are commented out as their current submap does not line up with the control room.
