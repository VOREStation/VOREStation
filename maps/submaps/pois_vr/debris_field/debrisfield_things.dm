im sorry<br>\
we tried to do everything we could for her<br>\

rnd wanted to take her apart and document what happened<br>\
but after watching her tear through three of my men like they were nothing<br>\
i just. i couldnt. they might fire me, but fuck the suits. the safety of the other staff here matter more.<br>\
her fucking dignity matters more.<br>\
<br>\
we managed to bait her into one of the escape pods. fired her out into the black.<br>\

hope nobody ever has to read this. has to find her.<br>\
if you do, im sorry.<br>\
i just hope whatever happens, she finds the mercy we werent equipped to give her.<br>\
