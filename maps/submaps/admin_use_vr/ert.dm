All energy weapons here come installed with standard power cells, but the spares on the racks are self-charging tech.<br>\

Some fancy new micro-RTG cells or something, I think?<br>\
<br>\
Point is they're fairly expensive and probably prototypes or something, so for the love of God and your own career don't lose any of them and put them back when you return from a sortie.<br>\

	info = {"To All Current ERT Members,<br>\
Be advised that use of the NRV Von Braun's shield generator (located adjacent to this document) is strongly recommended when responding to calls, but also that it is not impervious, nor is the ship's point defense system flawless.<br>\
<br>\
Recommended settings as follows:<br>\
Photonic: Off (PD will not work with it enabled!)<br>\
EM: On<br>\
Humanoids: Off<br>\
Atmospheric: Off<br>\
Hull Shield: On<br>\
Radius: 42<br>\
<br>\
The shield generator will tax the Von Braun's reserves greatly so try to use it sparingly. Do not be afraid to use it however, as the Von Braun represents the Company making a <i>significant</i> investment in this sector's future. I can bail you out if the occasional intern goes missing or you break something minor, but if you go flying this thing through an asteroid belt and get massive holes blown in it Central <b>will</b> make <u>everyone</u> involved disappear <b><u>permanently</b></u>.<br>\

/obj/item/weapon/paper/vonbraun_cannon
	name = "NRV Von Braun O.F.D. Console"
	info = {"To All Current ERT Members,<br>\
Given recent events, Central has finally cleared the paperwork that allowed us to install an Obstruction Field Disperser, or 'O.F.D.', on the Von Braun. Please note we had to get rid of the mech bay (that nobody was allowed to use anyway) so that's where you'll find it. Of course if you're reading this you already found it.<br>\
<br>\
They have thoughtfully provided a sensor console for aiming purposes. Check your targets before firing and for the love of all that is holy make sure the firing port is OPEN before you pull the trigger (that's the big button on the wall to your right) or the whole thing will blow up in your face.<br>\
<br>\
To aim the thing, input your aim direction, smack the 'PRECALIBRATE' button, and then fiddle the numbers up and down until you hit 100% accuracy. If the number is in the right spot it adds 25%, if you have a right number but it's in the wrong spot it adds 17%. A bit obtuse but you'll get the hang of it quickly.<br>\
<br>\
Loading it is simple. Just roll one of the big charges out of the racks and into the loading cradle, then give it a good shove. <u>Do not fall into the loading mechanism.</u> Make your shots count. Use the BLUE charges for electrical storms and ion clouds, and the RED charges for everything else (meteors, dust, critters). Don't bother trying to fire it at other ships, they have shields and maneuvering thrusters.<br>\
<br>\
<i>Lt. Cmdr. Sykes</i><br>\
<br>\
P.S. Before any of you ask, no, you cannot fire yourself or your teammates out of it for boarding purposes or 'hot drops', whatever those are. So please don't try."}
