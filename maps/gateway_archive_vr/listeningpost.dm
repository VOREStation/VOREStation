	info = {"I wonder how much longer they will accept my empty reports. They will cancel the case soon without
	results. When the pickup comes, I will tell them I have lost faith in our cause, and beg them to consider a diplomatic
	solution. How many nuclear teams have been dispatched with those nukes? I must try and prevent more from ever being sent.
	If they will not listen to reason, I will detonate the warehouse myself. Maybe some day in the immediate future, space
	will be peaceful, though I don't intend to live to see it. And that is why I write this down- it is my sacrifice that
	stabilised your worlds, traveller. Spare a thought for me, and please attempt to prevent nuclear proliferation, should
	it ever rear it's ugly head again. -Donk Co. Operative #451"}
