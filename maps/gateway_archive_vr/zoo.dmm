The Human phenotype is generally around 7�8 feet, and roughly 136.0 to 181.4 kilograms in weight, with a long, muscular tail and large, curved, oblong head. The Queen of this species is generally twice as large (they can grow even larger, some even up to 100 feet tall, and stronger if given time) and possesses superior speed, strength and intelligence. The term Xenomorph is derived from the Greek words xeno ('stranger', 'alien', and 'foreigner') and morphe ('form', 'shape'). There are no solid facts as to the origins of the Xenomorph species; instead, there are many assumptions which cannot be confirmed. Based on the limited information we have, the most commonly accepted hypothesis is that they are an artificially created species, although another hypothesis says that they evolved naturally on a planet much different than our own. The Xenomorph lives in a hive together with its queen. Amazingly, the blood and other bodily fluids of the Xenomorph are highly acidic. It is not yet understood how a creature of such biology can exist. The planet Proteus is also home to rare, red-hued Xenomorphs, who frequently fight their black-colored rivals.

Due to their voracious appetites and tendency to ruin mine shafts and infrastructure, they have been hunted almost to extinction, mainly by the Slavemasters.

The Queen of this species is generally twice as large (they can grow even larger, some even up to 100 feet tall, and stronger if given time) and possesses superior speed, strength and intelligence. The term Xenomorph is derived from the Greek words xeno ('stranger', 'alien', and 'foreigner') and morphe ('form', 'shape'). There are no solid facts as to the origins of the Xenomorph species; instead, there are many assumptions which cannot be confirmed. Based on the limited information we have, the most commonly accepted hypothesis is that they are an artificially created species, although another hypothesis says that they evolved naturally on a planet much different than our own. The Xenomorph lives in a hive together with its queen. Amazingly, the blood and other bodily fluids of the Xenomorph are highly acidic. It is not yet understood how a creature of such biology can exist. The planet Proteus is also home to rare, red-hued Xenomorphs, who frequently fight their black-colored rivals.

Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice, and open water, and for hunting seals, which made up most of its original diet. Although most polar bears are born on land, they spent most of their time on the sea ice. Their scientific name means 'maritime bear', and derives from this fact. Polar bears hunted their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals. However, because of habitat loss caused by climate change, the polar bear had gone completely extinct on Earth. The return of the polar bear is thanks to the preservation of genetic records written in the 21st century, which were later used by Space Russians to create a wildlife reserve on the planet Europa in 2492.
