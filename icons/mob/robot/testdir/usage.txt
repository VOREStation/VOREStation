This directory is for testing robot dmis direclty without the need to define the sprite datums.

For this, name the dmi in the following format: [sprite-name]_[x_size]x[y_size].dmi

Don't use underlines within the name!

An exaple would be: mydrake_64x64.dmi

The states inside the dmi then need to match the name, so all icons need to follow the common format:

mydrake
mydrake-[overlay]
etc.

Many examples for how the states should be named can be found in other robot dmis

In game, the "Reload Robot Test Sprites" can be used to reload the dmis for testing without the need to recompile the game.
