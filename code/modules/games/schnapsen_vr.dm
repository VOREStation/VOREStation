// this is a playing card deck based off of the Austrian/Hungarian national card game, Schnapsen
//TODO: Sprite up Double German/William Tell card icons. Sending this in as is as I suck at spriting and want to play schnapsen
//TODO: Implement functionality for "sub-decks": Create a over-schnapsen deck with nines, eights and sevens. 
//TODO:Let players choose 2,3,4 player mode to get decks of ace/ten/jack/queen/king + seven for 3 player, nine+eight for 4 player modes.
