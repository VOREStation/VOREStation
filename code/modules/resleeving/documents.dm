				<h1><a name="Foreword">Foreword: A Licensed Technology</a></h1>
				This message must remain attached to all documentation regarding Nanotrasen Resleeving Technology.<br>
				All Nanotrasen Resleeving Technology (NRT) is licensed to Nanotrasen by Kitsuhana Heavy Industries. It should only be used in the ways set forth in this guide.
				Special consideration to the moral and ethical use of this technology should be undertaken before applying it in the field. Make sure you understand the technology fully before using the machinery.<br>

				<h1><a name="Implant">The Mindstate Backup Implant</a></h1>
				Anyone wishing to enjoy the benefits of resleeving must have been implanted with a Mindstate Backup implant. These implants use advanced (licensed) technology to
				perform backups of the whole mindstate at periodic intervals. The backups are not constant, however, and being resleeved after death may result in memory loss for
				the time since the last backup until the demise of the body. Generally this can encompass anywhere from 5 to 50 minutes, though it has been known to be longer or shorter, depending
				on the timing of the backups, when the person expired, and when the resleeving was started.<br>
				<a href="#Contents">Contents</a>

				<h1><a name="Usage">How to Perform Resleeving</a></h1>
				The Nanotrasen Resleeving Technology consists of four machines:
				<ul>
					<li>The Growpod - For growing organic bodies.</li>
					<li>The SynthFab - For recreating synthetic bodies.</li>
					<li>The resleeving pod - For combining minds and bodies.</li>
					<li>The resleeving console - For controlling the other machines.</li>
				</ul>
				Performing resleeving is relatively simple. Nanotrasen maintains body-scan backups of all guests taken when you began your employment, applied for a visa, or at another time.
				These scans are stored in a database maintained by Nanotrasen, and are sent to stations where it may become necessary to put them to use. You can view all the current body scans at the
				resleeving console. You can also view all current mindstate backups at the console.<br>
				The process of resleeving is simply:
				<ol>
					<li>Select a body to create from the body records. This should be the person's original body, or a suitable donor body if none is available.</li>
					<li>Create the body using either the SynthFab or the growpod. Upon completion, correct any issues with the body (typically slight genetic or other damage will have occurred).</li>
					<li>Place the body into the resleeving pod, and select an appropriate mind to sleeve into the body on the console.</li>
					<li>Sleeve the mind into the body, using the console.</li>
				</ol>
				Being resleeved can be a disorienting and painful process. It is very likely that the person will need to acclimate to their new body, and should be given a place to rest for several minutes while
				they get used to their motor functions. Resleeving tends to remap these, so it may take a while for the person to become fully acclimated driving their new body.<br>

				<h1><a name="Cards">How to Utilize Sleevecards</a></h1>
				A Sleevecard is a small portable device capable of running a human-intelligence mind and providing limited mobility. The reasons for using a
				sleevecard for a mind can be numerous, such as the person lacking a complete body scan to restore their body from, restoring persons at high-risk of
				self-harm for counseling in a form more easily restrained, or even restoring criminals to stand trial without providing them the means of escape.<br>
				Whatever the case, please ensure that all necessary legal policies and departmental guidelines are followed when using sleevecards. They are intended
				to be helpful to the subject and allow them to be aware while whatever complications preventing them from having a body are resolved, not as a permanent form.<br>
				<b>Note:</b> Sleevecards perform wireless mind backups and do not require any sort of implant, however, to ensure a current backup of the person, insert the sleevecard back into
				the resleeving pod before resleeving them into another form, and a current snapshot will be taken. No memory loss should occur in this case.<br>

				<h1><a name="Considerations">Special Considerations</a></h1>
				There are some special considerations to be taken into account while using resleeving technology:<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Resleeving someone while they were already in a living body is extremely disorienting, and can cause memory corruption or loss in some cases. <b>It may be considered medical malpractice. It should only be used as a last resort.</b></li>
					<li>Resleeving a mind into a body with a mind already present is <b>extremely unethical</b> and is <b>considered murder</b> in Nanotrasen space. You should not do it under any circumstances.</li>
					<li>Needlessly printing copies of bodies wastes resources, and though biomass, metal, and glass may be readily available, these bodies are the property of their original mind. <b>Only print 'spares' with consent.</b></li>
				</ul>
				Please keep these in mind while using the Nanotrasen Resleeving Technology.<br>
