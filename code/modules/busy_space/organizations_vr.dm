			the fastest building power. The core planet of Gaia is known for having a proud military culture \
			that, ironically, tends to stomp out any idea of warmongering from their cadets due to their \
			scarred history and the Federation's ideals."

				members. The United Federation itself found its roots in the aftermath of the Bloody \
				Valentine Civil War, a racially motivated war that occurred in 2550 during the last year of \
				the Federation Alliance of Gaia between the Genetically Modified and so-called Naturalists. \
				Neutral nations in Gaia's political sphere, encouraged by alien observers, formed the United \
				Federation when the indiscriminate loss of life became intolerable. 2555 saw the official \
				signing of the Federation Charter between the core planet members."

			pride themselves on their ability to avoid consequence. Their post-scarcity allows them to rebuild, regrow, and replenish almost any \
			lost asset or resource nearly instantly. It leads to many of the Kitsuhana 'members' treating everything with frivolity, \
