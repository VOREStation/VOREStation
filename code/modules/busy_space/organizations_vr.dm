			weapons after a massive uprising, creating a new found reason to rebel. SolGov began to wage a bloody struggle against \

    		June 15th 2561, when Imperial Navy cartographers stumbled upon the Virgo-Erigone system, far from the influence of the USDF. \
    		Though little is currently known about the Golden Empire, their scholars have been willing to share some information. They \
    		are currently ruled by a woman referred to as Empress Gutamir who is allegedly hundreds of years old. Images and portraits \
    		of the empress depict a tall woman with an idealized figure of beauty as might have been seen in ancient Roman or Greek \
    		works of art. She has white hair, silvery eyes, and a fair complexion. Whether or not these images are an authentic or \
    		even an accurate depiction remains unknown. Vessels of the Golden Empire utilize technology unlike anything humans have ever \
    		seen. Although they use bluespace for FTL travel, the methods in which they tap into bluespace has yet to be studied in any \
    		detail by human scientists. Their kind hails from a binary system of Earth-like worlds called Sanctum and Venio, though the \
    		exact location of these worlds is not known due to a culture of secrecy toward outsiders."

    		Their home system is said to host not one but two Earth-like worlds, both of which have been home to elves as far as their \
    		records go back. How the elves were able to travel between these worlds is currently unknown, but apparently they have been \
    		doing so for at least the last 2000 years. However, from what is understood, until only 300 years ago, these accomplishments \
    		were only made possible by a very limited number of ships apparently using borrowed technology from an undiscovered \
    		civilization they call \"Architectus.\" Curiously, the Golden Empire's primary language is strikingly similar to ancient \
    		Latin on Earth, indicating that they may have somehow come into contact with Earth at some point in their history. However, \
