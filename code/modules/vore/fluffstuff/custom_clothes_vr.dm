/* TUTORIAL
	"icon" is the file with the HUD/ground icon for the item
	"icon_state" is the iconstate in this file for the item
	"icon_override" is the file with the on-mob icons, can be the same file
	"item_state" is the iconstate for the on-mob icons:
		item_state_s is used for worn uniforms on mobs
		item_state_r and item_state_l are for being held in each hand
		some do not have a suffix, like gloves. plan accordingly, maybe add _mob?
	"overlay_state" is the iconstate for ties/accessories, for some reason they don't
		just use the item_state variable

	If you don't have a special HUD/ground sprite, don't worry about it.
	Just set both the icon_state and item_state to the same thing,
	and it will use the top direction sprite (facing the viewer)
	for your HUD/item sprite. This usually looks fine!

	Advanced:
	"item_state_slots" can replace "item_state", it is a list:
		item_state_slots["slotname1"] = "item state for that slot"
		item_state_slots["slotname2"] = "item state for that slot"
