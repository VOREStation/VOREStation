//To do list:
//Main list, Add crates to cargo that allows crew to get city and planets. Make sure they function as listed bellow.
//
//City:
//City crates will come with a briefcase for buildings and a box for tracks.
//Buildings with start in bags that can be placed down and turned into a chosen building of a certian color. Should be at least 4 buildings per briefcase.
//Buildings should act a bit like lockers allowing for players at max shrink (%25) to enter them. Buildings should beable to be destroyed.
//
//Track briefcases will come with 13 Road pieces ( 3 of each individual piece.) and 1 car.
//Track pieces should check for player scale, if less then 100% they can step on them without applying the Stomp sprites. If greater then 100% players that step on them will leave the stomp decal and play a sound.
//
//Planets:
//Planet bags will come with a random set of three planets, and a random ship toy. With a very small chance of winning a "real" planet being umong the sets. The bag will switch to the _empty sprite and be catagorized the same as a garbage.
//Planets should be able to be eaten and play a spark effect after the first bite, swapping the plantes sprite with one of the asteriouds and letting them be nibbled on two more times.
//
//Secondary, Add options for crew to change their stomp sprite / allow for custom stomps, Make the cars and ships drivable for 25% crew.
//Drivable toys: Possibly take code from rolling chairs? Look for clown car.
//Custom sounds for EVERYTHING.
