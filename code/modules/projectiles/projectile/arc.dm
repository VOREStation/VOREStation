// These projectiles are somewhat different from the other projectiles in the code.

// moving up, then down as it approaches the target. There is also a small shadow effect that follows the projectile
// as its flying.

// Besides the visuals, arcing projectiles do not collide with anything until they reach the target, as they fly over them.
// For best effect, use this only when it makes sense to do so, IE on the Surface. The projectiles don't care about ceilings or gravity.
