	Focused on sleek ‘futurist’ designs which have largely fallen out of fashion but remain popular with collectors and people hoping to make some quick thalers from replica weapons. \
	Bishamonten weapons tended to be form over function - despite their flashy looks, most were completely unremarkable one way or another as weapons and used very standard firing mechanisms."
