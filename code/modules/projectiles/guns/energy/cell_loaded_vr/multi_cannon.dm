	It makes use of the Vey-Med ML-3 'Medigun' microbattery technology, combining the effects of multiple 'microbatteries' into single 'macrobatteries' that are built around precursor void cores, \
	allowing for the batteries to self-charge for prolonged field use. However, the weakened beams caused by the use of ununderstood technology created a need for a VERY strong focus, \
	which lead to the Healcannon becoming a very bulky tool. Fortunately, it's not as heavy as it looks."
