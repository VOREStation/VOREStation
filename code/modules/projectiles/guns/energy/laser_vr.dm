/* TUTORIAL
	"icon" is the file with the HUD/ground icon for the item
	"icon_state" is the iconstate in this file for the item
	"icon_override" is the file with the on-mob icons, can be the same file
	"item_state" is the iconstate for the on-mob icons:
		item_state_s is used for worn uniforms on mobs
		item_state_r and item_state_l are for being held in each hand

	"item_state_slots" can replace "item_state", it is a list:
		item_state_slots["slotname1"] = "item state for that slot"
		item_state_slots["slotname2"] = "item state for that slot"

	on guns, in particular:
	item_state being null makes it look for exactly the icon_state in the on-mob file,
		including any 0,75,etc appended from the energy bar setting
	item_state being present prevents different mode sprites, sadly, but you may
		be able to override this on the gun itself with a proc
