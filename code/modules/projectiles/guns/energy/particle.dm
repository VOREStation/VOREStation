	failure, making them unsuitable as military weapons in practical situations as they are prone to backfiring and \
	jamming, though they perform as adequately as any laser weapon in vacuum. Nonetheless, they have found a niche among \
	miners and salvage crews, as their lack of usefulness as a firearm in habitable areas means most authorities do not \
	classify them as dangerous weapons (at least, not dangerous to whoever they're pointed at) - instead, in most \
	jurisdictions including NT space, APP guns are officially classed as mining equipment rather than firearms."
