/*
 * Handles lasertag attacks. Anything can call this.
 * Target can be a mob or a lasertag vest on the ground.
 * Attacker can be null (if vest_override is set) or a human mob
 * tag_damage is how much damage is dealt to the vest (defaults to 1 if no value given)
 * vest_override allows attacking without wearing a vest (defaults to FALSE)
 * required_vest is a list of what vests are required to have on to do damage
 * allowed_suits are what vests the attack is able to deal damage to. Must be a LIST. If not passed, we assume all suits are valid targets.
 * returns TRUE if damage was (theoretically) dealt. FALSE if not.
