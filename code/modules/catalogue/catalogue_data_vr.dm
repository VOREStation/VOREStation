	desc = "Canidaela is an artificially created species from Gliese 581d. They are composed of bipedal \
	genetically engineered members of the Canidae family, who are sometimes also hybrids. Their traits \
	differ from one member to the next, however they all have the same temperature adaptations, survivable\
	from -70째C to 30째C, and comfortable from -50째C to 20째C, all share the same engineered digestive system.\
	The digestive system has an extremely stretchy build allowing for greatly increased capacity, a jaw bone\
	which is able to come unhinged at will, a bluespace capable intestine which stores extra nutrients in\
	bluespace and maintains the user at a healthy weight so long as enough or more than enough nutrients are\
	consumed, and a stomach which can be controlled at will and sports increased digestive capabilities.\
	<br><br>\
	They were created as a part of a research experiment, which had a primary purpose of studying the\
	integration of isolated communities of intelligent species into the galactic spacefaring community to\
	potentially make integrating any such species in the future more easy. The experiments also had the\
	secondary purposes of studying such things as the development of cultures, and the progression of\
	idealistic communities in which most of their needs are provided for.\
	<br><br>\
	The original plan was to keep the community in the dark about other space faring civilizations until\
	they managed to become spacefaring by their own means. After the details of the experiment were exposed,\
	and the scientists came under heavy criticism by the public, they were forced to cut the experiment short,\
	coming up from their bunker and telling the subjects the truth and offering them the ride away from the planet."
