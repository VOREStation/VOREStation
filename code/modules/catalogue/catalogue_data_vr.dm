	desc = "ERROR : DNA corruption detected. The likely outcome of this is this specimen being \
	a Xenochimera. Xenochimeras are the end stage of “Roanoke Syndrome”, a microbial infection \
	that infiltrates the immune system of a host species by mimicking cells. Upon expiration of \
	the host (preventable by medical attention), the cells cannibalize and take over the body, \
	creating a xenochimera. If the body has been capable of sapient thought, the resultant morph \
	is also capable of thought. \

	Contrary to popular belief, Roanoke Syndrome colonies do not seek out sapient life. Any exposure \
	is incidental and not part of a plot – xenochimera without sapient thought are simply wild animals or disease vectors."

	3000 to 4000 years ago, residing on a planet called “Altam”. Vulpkanin diverged from the precursors due \
	to heavy isolation after the fall, presumably due to being a freshly found colony. A lack of material support \
	regressed their technology to pre-industrial standards, from which they had to recover from in long and hard years. At the point \
	of discovery by human explorers, they have formed an early interplanetary society and accession into the Diaspora went over relatively smoothly. \
	Vulpkanin are the closest successor to the precursors, genetically, although genelocked devices still do not \

	NT-495, also colloquial known as “Shadekin”, “Deep People”, “Mar Beast”, “Shadow creature” are an enigmatic species \
	capable of localized bluespace events (although the credibility of them actually manipulating bluespace effects \
	still is in question), allowing them to “shift” through phases of existence without assistance of machines. \
	Observation of NT-495 is notoriously difficult, as they do not exhibit these traits when in direct view unless \
	they seem to feel threatened. \

	Their definite sapience has been proven as several NT-495 sightings supports them to be capable of galactic common, \
