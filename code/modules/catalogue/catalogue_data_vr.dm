	organising themselves in tribes in the past, the modern Sergal lives in a post-industrial world \

	Having a similar appearance to feathered dinosaurs with a distinct case of sexual dimorphism, \
	Nevreans have very distinct and unparalleled differences between their genders. \
	Because of their sexual dimorphism, both male and female Nevreans could be considered their own species at a glance, \
	due to the vast array of both mental, physical, and social differences between male and female Nevrean. \
	Existing often as immigrants and refugees in the past due to the Tal world war, \
	Nevreans were treated poorly by the other two Eltus races, and had little to no rights in civilized society outside of Nevrea. \
	The modern Nevrean eventually gained equal rights among the Eltus species in Gold Ring, \

	the host (preventable by medical attention), the cells cannibalize and take over the body, \

	3000 to 4000 years ago, residing on a planet called “Altam”. Vulpkanin diverged from the precursors due \
	to heavy isolation after the fall, presumably due to being a freshly found colony. A lack of material support \
	regressed their technology to pre-industrial standards, from which they had to recover from in long and hard years. At the point \
	of discovery by human explorers, they have formed an early interplanetary society and accession into the Diaspora went over relatively smoothly. \

	NT-495, also colloquial known as “Shadekin”, “Deep People”, “Mar Beast”, “Shadow creature” are an enigmatic species \
	capable of localized bluespace events (although the credibility of them actually manipulating bluespace effects \

	Their definite sapience has been proven as several NT-495 sightings supports them to be capable of galactic common, \
