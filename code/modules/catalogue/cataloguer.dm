/*
	This is a special scanner which exists to give explorers something to do besides shoot things.
	The scanner is able to be used on certain things in the world, and after a variable delay, the scan finishes,
	giving the person who scanned it some fluff and information about what they just scanned,
	as well as points that currently do nothing but measure epeen,
	and will be used as currency in The Future(tm) to buy things explorers care about.

	Scanning hostile mobs and objects is tricky since only mobs that are alive are scannable, so scanning
	them requires careful position to stay out of harms way until the scan finishes. That is why
	the person with the scanner gets a visual box that shows where they are allowed to move to
	without inturrupting the scan.
