// This object holds the code that is needed to execute an event.
// Code for judging whether doing that event is a good idea or not belongs inside its meta event object.


/*

Important: DO NOT `sleep()` in any of the procs here, or the GM will get stuck. Use callbacks insead.
Also please don't use spawn(), but use callbacks instead.

Note that there is an important distinction between an event being ended, and an event being finished.
- Ended is for when the actual event is over, regardless of whether an announcement happened or not.
- Finished is for when both the event itself is over, and it was announced. The event will stop being
processed after it is finished.

For an event to finish, it must have done two things:
- Go through its entire cycle, of start() -> end(), and
- Have the event be announced.
If an event has ended, but the announcement didn't happen, the event will not be finished.
This allows for events that have their announcement happen after the end itself.
