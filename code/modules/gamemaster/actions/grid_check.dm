// New grid check event:
// Very similar to the old one, power goes out in most of the colony, however the new feature is the ability for engineering to
// get power back on sooner, if they are able to reach a special machine and initiate a manual reboot.  If no one is able to do so,
// it will reboot itself after a few minutes, just like the old one.  Bad things happen if there is no grid checker machine protecting
// the powernet when this event fires.

	// First, the Supermatter engine makes a power spike.

	// After that, the engine checks if a grid checker exists on the same powernet, and if so, it triggers a blackout.
	// If not, lots of stuff breaks.  See code/modules/power/generator.dm for that piece of code.
