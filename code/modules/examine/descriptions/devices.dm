	description_info = "This device allows someone to speak to another player sourced from the observer pool, as well as other communicators linked to it.  \
	To use the device, use it in your hand, and it will open an interface with various buttons.  Near the bottom will be a list of devices currently available \
	for you to call, both from communications on the station, and communicators very far away (observers).  To call someone, send a communications request to \
	someone and hope they respond, or receive one yourself and respond to them.  Hanging up is also simple, and is handled in the 'Manage Connections' tab."

	description_fluff = "As a concept, a device that allows long-distance communication has existed for over five hundred years.  A device that can accomplish \
	that while in space, across star systems, and that the consumer can afford and use without training, is much more recent, and is thanks to the backbone \
	that is the Exonet.<br>\
	<br>\
	The Exonet is the predominant interstellar telecomm system, servicing trillions of devices across a large portion of human-controlled space.  \
	It is distributed by a massive network of telecommunication satellites, some privately owned and others owned by the systems’ local governments, \
	that utilize FTL technologies to bounce data between satellites at speeds that would not be possible at sub-light technology.  This communicator \
	uses a protocol called Exonet Protocol Version 2, generally shortened to EPv2.<br>\
	<br>\
	EPv2 is the most common communications protocol in the Exonet, and was specifically designed for it.  It was designed to facilitate communication \
	between any device in a star system, and have the ability to forward interstellar requests at the root node of that system’s Exonet.  \
	It is also built to cope with the reality that the numerous nodes in a system will likely have frequent outages.  The protocol allows for \
	up to 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 unique addresses, one of which is assigned to this device."

	description_antag = "Electromagnetic pulses will cause the device to disconnect all linked communicators.  Turning off the Exonet node at the Telecomms \
	satellite will also accomplish this, but for all communicators on and near the station.  This may be needed to allow for a quiet kill or capture."
