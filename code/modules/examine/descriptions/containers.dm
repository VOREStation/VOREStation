The drink has become so popular, in fact, that Nikolas Beverages bought it.  Ever since then, the drink has never been the same.  As a result, people all across known space beg for the old formula, but Nikolas Beverages does not appear to be listening."

	description_fluff = "This drink is advertised as one of the most carbonated beverages on the market.  It's owned by Federov Beverages, and advertised for its carbonation, not its flavor.
