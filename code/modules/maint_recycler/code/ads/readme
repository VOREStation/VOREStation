These ads, while designed for the maint vendor, are technically speaking non exclusive. if you're not using them for it, do whatever you want, however, for the vendor itself:

There's two categories of ads.
	The "Official" ones are old, ~40 years. about a decade after the start of the second expansion w/ the lore at the time of writing. The ads, as such, should be for older stuff, and have an older theme. you know, 1980's esq. Be considerate. For example, Vey-Med (at the time of writing) only existed around the turn of the century, so before the cutoff.

	The "Unofficial" ads have a lot more leeway in terms of time period, and can be modern.

ads can lead to URLs, just give flavor text, or lead to a product in the vendor. Be reasonable. don't link to porn or anything or I'll personally kill you.
