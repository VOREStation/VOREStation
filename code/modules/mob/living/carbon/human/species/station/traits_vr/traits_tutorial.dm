/*
A new Ability given to those human mobs that have a non-zero number of traits.
Verb is added by /datum/trait/proc/apply() in code\modules\mob\living\carbon\human\species\station\traits_vr\trait.dm file.
This proc gets called whenever the user is spawned, resleeved, autoresleeved and so forth.
If there are special cases that do NOT call this var that result in a completely new body -
I will fix it once I am informed of their existence.
Been tested - does NOT lead to multiples of the verb thanks to the |=.
Given the apply() proc is only called if they have verbs - this should avoid it erronously popping up for traitless people.

This ability intends to retrieve all positive, neutral and negative traits chosen in the character set-up
then retrieve their relevant vars by assuming the character's species has the full list. This should always work. Should

The ability is intended to be developed both as a to_chat() and a tgui window.
The user is given the ability to choose which they would like whenever they press the ability to better suit whatever scenario they find themselves
thirsty for knowledge.

When adding new tutorials for trait subtypes, use <br> rather than \n newlines
