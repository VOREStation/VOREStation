/*
LORE:
Gaslamps are a phoron-based life form endemic to the world of Virgo-3B. They are
a sort of fungal organism with physical ties to Diona and Vox, deriving energy
for movement from a gentle combustion-like reaction in their bodies using
atmospheric phoron, carefully filtered trace oxygen, and captured meat products.
Over-exposure to oxygen causes their insides to burn too hot and eventually
kills them.

TODO: Make them light up and heat the air when exposed to oxygen.
