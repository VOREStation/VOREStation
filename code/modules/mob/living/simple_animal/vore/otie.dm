// ToDo: Make this code not a fucking snowflaky horrible broken mess. Do not use until it's actually fixed. It's miserably bad right now.

// Probably easier to troubleshoot when we ain't breaking the server by spawning a buttload of heavily extra feature coded snowflake mobs to the wilderness as mass cannonfodder.
