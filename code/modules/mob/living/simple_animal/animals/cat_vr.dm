She curls up on the floor, slowly kneading the air as her stomach moves its contents — including you — deeper into her digestive system.",
		"Your form begins to slowly soften and break apart, rounding out Runtime's swollen belly. The carnivorous cat rumbles and purrs happily at the feeling of such a filling meal.")
