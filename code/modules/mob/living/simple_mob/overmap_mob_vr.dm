//So this is a bit weird, but I tried to make this as adaptable as I could
//There are two working parts of an overmap mob, but I made it look like there is only one as far as the players are concerned.
//The /obj/effect/overmap/visitable/simplemob is the part people will actually see. It follows the mob around and changes dir to look as mob-ish as it can.
//The /mob/living/simple_mob/vore/overmap is NOT VISIBLE normally, and is the part that actually does the work most of the time.
//Being a simplemob, the mob can wander around and affect the overmap in whatever way you might desire.
//Whatever it does, the /visitable/simplemob will follow it, and does all the functional parts relating to the OM
//including scanning, and housing Z levels people might land on.

//The MOB being invisible presents some problems though, which I am not entirely sure how to resolve
//Such as, being unable to be attacked by other mobs, and possibly unable to be attacked by players.
//This does not at all prevent the mob from attacking other things though 
//so in general, please ensure that you never spawn these where players can ordinarily access them.

//The mob was made invisible though, because the sensors can't detect invisible objects, so when the /visitable/simplemob was made invisible
//it refused to show up on sensors, and a few simple changes to the sensors didn't rectify this. So, rather than adding in more spaghetti to make
//simplemobs scannable (WHICH I DID, AND IT WORKED SOMEHOW), Aronai and I found that this was the better solution for making all the parts function like I'd like.
//Since I also want it to be possible to land on the overmap object.
