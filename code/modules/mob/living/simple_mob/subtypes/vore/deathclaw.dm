	<br><br>\
	Originally the Deathclaw was a top secret genetics project that was run by ancestral Zorren which was \
	lost to time. While it is not immediately evident in their body structure, these creatures bare a \
	subtle genetic connection to Zorren, however, this connection is marred by the other genes that \
	have been grafted onto the DNA strucutre of the Deathclaw. The creatures are known to attack humans \
	and other animals regularly to protect their territory or to hunt for food. It is speculated that \
	they escaped roughly around the time as whatever calamity befell the Zorren many centuries ago \
	as sighting of these beasts in the wild began around that time according to recovered Zorren texts. \
	<br>\
	Deathclaws are a large, carnivorous, bipedal reptile species, designed for maximum lethality. \
	Deathclaws are made even more dangerous by their reproductive instincts. deathclaws are an oviparous species, \
	female deathclaws will lay eggs in clusters, sired by the strongest male deathclaws in the pack, typically the alpha male.\
	<br>\
	These creatures are considered an invasive species, and thus hunters are encouraged to hunt them \
	although they are cautioned when doing so due to the danger that the creature poses."
