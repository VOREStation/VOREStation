	<br><br>\
	Snakes are elongated, limbless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes \
	Like all other squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. \
	Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, \
	enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. \
	This particular species of snake has likely been mutated by deliberate gene manipulation of some sort and as a \
	result has grown to unnatural size. Biologically this snake is no different than that of the common snake, \
	but this species has been known to have increased hostility towards wildlife. Scientists are still studying \
	this new species for any differences in behavior or biology beyond the increase in size. \
	<br>\
	This species of snake is nonvenomous and use their large bodies to primarily subdue their prey. \
	Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill them by constriction - this is dependant on the prey. \
	<br>\
	This snake is extremely hostile to all wildlife and living beings and should be avoided at all costs. \
	People who spot these creatures are urged to inform the nearest militant entity so that they can be \
	dealt with in a professional manner."
