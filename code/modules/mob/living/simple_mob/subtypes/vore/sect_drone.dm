	<br><br>\
	A massively-sized insect that is native to Virgo 3B. Much like its queen, it bears the combined physical traits \
	of several of Earth's insects. Its forelegs have claws bearing serrated edges much like a Mantis, which it uses \
	in both self-defense and during its hunts. On it's back are two large semi transparent wings like a beetle that it \
	uses for increased mobility. Covering its body is a layer of light, thick, and protective chitin, resilient enough to absorb \
	most physical damage while being light enough for the Sect Drone to hover. \
	<br>\
	It is not uncommon for a Sect Drone to go out alone to search for potential prey to bring back to the nest. \
	Regardless of reason, it is cautioned against approaching a Sect Drone as, like their queen, their behaviour is wildly \
	inconsistent. A Sect Drone can vary from hostile to docile depending on certain factors that scientists have \
	yet to uncover. \
	<br>\
	The lack  of chitin on the underside of its abdomen is deliberate, as the flesh is very elastic and stretchable, \
	allowing the drone to carry multiple large prey inside of its stomach with relative ease."
