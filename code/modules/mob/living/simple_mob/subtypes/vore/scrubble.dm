Somehow it manages to squeeze you completely into a gut that should rightly be far too small for anything but a mouse, bundling up your body into a tight ball as the walls around you clench in tightly to keep you nice and compact. The sounds of burbling and glorping echo through the intensely tight space as the stomach lining grinds in thick oozes against your skin, pressure so high that you can barely move a muscle."

	The Scrubble is a small creature found in redgate locations that has properties resembling those of rodents and vulpines. \
	Primarily a scavanger, the scrubble is known to eat all sorts of organic material, whether it's vegetable or meat, but generally does not hunt on its own. Largely defenseless against larger creature, the scrubble is certainly a prey species. \
	Their geneneral behaviour supports this, as they will heavily avoid interaction with any other species that approach it, usually darting away rapidly and keeping a distance. However, they have been known to act defensively should they be completely cornered."
