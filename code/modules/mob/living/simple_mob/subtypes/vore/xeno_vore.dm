	desc = "Under normal circumstances, a xenomorph is more than capable of parasitic reproduction, discharging \
	digestive acid at high velocities, and utilizing the blade at the blade at the end of its long tail as a \
	far-reaching melee weapon. However, this particular instance of xenomorph is capable of none of these things. \
	\"Defanged\" is not used literally in this case when referring to these types of xenomorphs since their fangs, \
	ironically, are still intact. What it does mean is that the creature's other more lethal components have been \
	surgically removed, usually for the purposes of keeping it in captivity in the same way that one may de-claw a \
	lion in for keeping it in a zoo. This xenomorph has had its reproductive organs, as well as its acid-spitting \
	glands, and the blade at the end of its tail removed. Its claws and fangs however are left intact. The ethicality \
	of this practice on captive xenomorphs has been frequently challenged by animal activists."
