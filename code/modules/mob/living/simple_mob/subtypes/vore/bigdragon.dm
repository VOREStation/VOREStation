/*
HARK, YON CODE DIVER.
What lays before you is a lot of spaghetti in order to make a fairly unique boss mob.
Scour its code if you dare.

Here's a summary, however.

This is a 128x64px mob with sprites drawn by Przyjaciel (thanks mate) and some codersprites.

The bigdragon is an 800 health hostile boss mob with three special attacks.
The first (disarm intent) is a charge attack that activates when the target is >5 tiles away and requires line of sight.
While charging, the dragon can run up/down cliffs harmlessly, but will thunk into objects for a brief stun.
Charging requires direct line of sight to start the attack.
Charging directly onto someone deals 50 brute and stuns them, likely with vore to follow.
Charging next to someone will deal 20 brute and send them flying.

The second (grab intent) is a tail sweep attack that activates when 2 or more hostiles are within 2 tiles of it.
The tail sweep deals 20 brute to all targets and throws them back a great distance with a brief stun.
Tail sweeping while ontop of a target will deal 50 brute like the charge above.

The third (harm intent) is a telegraphed flame swathe attack. The inidividual flame pellets deal 30 burn each and set mobs and carbons on fire alike.
This attack is the mobs default attack.

When the big dragon is below 1/2 health, or was previously friendly and was pissed off, it will enrage.
While enraged, the dragon will NOT stop and stand still while telegraphing its attacks.
This is exceptionally dangerous, as it will actively breathe fire whilest pursuing a target.

DO NOT challenge this beast in open fields. You need cover to survive.
Unless you're a tesh or something I guess. Speed.

As a flex, this mob has six vore organs.
It will swap between two variants (heal and digest) depending on if it's friendly or not.
It will eat prey with its maw, which has code in place to automatically push prey deeper over time.
The mob will only get increased "fullness" for prey who have made it to its stomach. Y'know. So the fat sprites make sense.

This mob can be made friendly by supplying it with a gold coin or a gold ingot. I'd make it every gold item, but then you could just raid its hoard for an easy tame. And that's lame.

While friendly, it will actively search for players with <95% health and attempt to vore them into its heal bellies.
On success, the targets are also injected with some helpful chemicals. Just to make sure they don't.. y'know, die while being swallowed.

The mobs icons are modular and interchangeable, there's even a neat verb in the abilities tab when player controlled to pick and choose what you want.
Otherwise, when naturally spawned, their icons are picked from a curated list.

I think I covered everything.
