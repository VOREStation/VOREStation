	<br><br>\
	A cousin to the dragons of space, Phoron Dragons are a rare and rather unique sight to see in the wilds of Virgo 3b. \
	Their terrifying appearance isn't just for looks, the black scales with mutated Phoron deposits in the skin are meant \
	to intimidate and frighten potential prey. They are mainly carnivorous in nature but can survive off of a mixed diet \
	of meats and plant based foods in certain circumstances - usually these circumstances are not ideal for the predator. \
	It is unknown still how the Phoron Dragon came to be but scientists speculate that common Dragons such as Red Dragons \
	somehow ended up on Virgo 3b and through a period of evolutionary mutation became the modern day Phoron Dragon.\
	<br>\
	Female dragons will often lay a clutch of eggs similar to that of other reptilian species after she is properly mated. \
	Females will go through a heat cycle once every season and will actively seek a mate in order to copulate. Males during \
	this time of season have been known to be increasingly hostile. Travellers are warned against traversing in the wilds \
	during these seasons because of the increased hostility.\
	<br>\
	Unlike their more fiery cousins, these dragons do not breathe flames as it would ignite both the surrounding Phoron and \
	the internal Phoron deposits of its body. Scientists still do not know how or when in the evolutionary chain they lost \
	their signature fire breath but it was likely very early in the chain otherwise the entire species would be extinct."
