	The titan pitcher plant is a rare carnivorous plant found in redgate locations. Unlike typical pitfall type pitcher plants that we are familiar with in realspace, these variants are far more aggressive. \
	When their defense mechanisms are triggered, by sensing vibrations through their extensive root systems, long tendrils emerge from the mouth of these plants to ensnare living creatures nearby. These creatures are dragged into the stomach-like bell shaped cavity of the plant and the rigid leaf closes as a lid. \
	Despite the size of these plants, they are perfectly capable of trapping an adult human and should be treated with heavy caution. More typically, they predate on small mammals and reptiles in their local ecological environment."
