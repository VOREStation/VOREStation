As you settle, you are completely hidden away inside of it's serpentine body, left to complete darkness and the sounds of squelching bodily functions. Movement is not difficult as the flesh around you is easily pushed back, but it quickly snaps back into place to keep you constrained. Slowly, the neon liquid that you could see from the outside of the creature begins to seep into the chamber.

	<br><br>\
	Scel, colloquially known as Voidwyrms, are creatures originating from outside of realspace, typically found at extradimensional breaches such as redpsace tears or within redgate locations. \
	While they are known to appear in many variants, the serpentine shape with antennae or whiskers is known to be the most common, due to being the closest and most accurate approximation of their natural forms from their home reality. \
	Scel bodies, contrary to popular belief, are not slime. They are solid matter, but are still incredibly malleable, which they use to 'shapeshift' when desired. The shifting is limited to just their figure. A scel attempting to look human would still have black squishy flesh and glowing eyes and spots for example. \
	Various other appendages seem to manifest at will, growing out of their body when needed. Tentacles are by-far the most preferred and commonly seen, but hardened legs and even clawed hands have been seen. While able to shapeshift into even human or animal shapes, it is always in shape only, and certain traits are universal. \
	Six eyes that match the color of their 'Goo', universally black and lacking in bones, and no body heat at all, typically matching the temperature of whatever environment they find themselves in. \
	Organs and bones as we understand them are nonexistant, and their body is made up of two main quantifiable substances. The black 'Flesh' that makes up the majority of their matter. It is solid yet incredibly malleable to the touch, and has been described as feeling 'slick'. \
	The next is the viscous liquid that seems to be the source of their color. This liquid seems to fulfill many properties for the Scel, shifting in transluscent pockets inside of their body. \
	Both their flesh and 'goo' dissipate into a fine black mist within hours of being seperated from its host, or the death of the subject. \
	Scel are sapient, and are therefore hard to predict, many have been immediately hostile, while a rare few have even taught themselves our language. Contact has been sparse though. What has been discovered is that most Scel seem to act independantly, with no formal governance. \
	Their alien mindset seems to have difficulty adapting to our world, further causing contact attempts to degrade into misunderstandings. \
	Scel, once breached into realspace, seem incredibly hesitant to return to their own reality, and are likely to be found in places with little to no natural light, as it seems to confuse their senses."
