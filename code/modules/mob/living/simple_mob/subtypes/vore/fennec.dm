	<br><br>\
	The Fennec fox is a small crepuscular fox native to Earth in Sol that nearly went extinct in the 2030s.\
	Through conservation efforts and the rise of space colonies, the Fennec was brought back from the brink \
	and is now labeled as 'Least Concern'. During the great Sol Expansion Period, Fennec were brought with \
	colonist as a means of companionship and as a ecosystem balance for desert worlds such as Virgo 4. \
	Their presence on Virgo 4 is largely due to convergent evolution. While their genetics are closely \
	related to their Sol counterparts, they are in fact a totally different species of fennec that have followed. \
	a separate evolutional path. Virgo Fennec are upwards of five times larger than their Sol cousins and consequently \
	have a larger appetite. Their diet mainly consists of whatever small creatures that they manage to scrounge from \
	the sands of Virgo 4, however they have been known to hunt larger prey in desperate times.\
	<br>\
	Fennec foxes reach sexual maturity at around nine months and mate between January and April \
	They usually breed only once per year. After mating, the male becomes very aggressive and protects \
	the female, provides her with food during pregnancy and lactation.\
	<br>\
	Virgo Fennecs have been observed to be passive and do not actively hunt large prey as their bodies have \
	grown accustomed to less available food sources. However, travellers are still cautioned on approaching \
	them as Virgo Fennec have been known to swallow prey whole depending on the prey's size."
