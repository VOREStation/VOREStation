	<br><br>\
	Canis Lupus Greatus, or Great Wolf, is a very large predator not beleived to be native to Sif (because it's a wolf, duh), but it has been never been found anywhere else. Despite their size, they are gentle, unless disturbed.\
	The majority of a great white wolf's long life is spent much the same as ordinary wolves. However, great wolves usually do not trouble themselves with small prey like humans, \
	usually preferring instead to hunt Saviks and Kururaks, and sometimes, leopardmanders or invasive red dragons. \
	Though usually docile towards humans and other large sapients, neesless to say, these wolves posesses great strength and a lethal bite. \
	a provoked great wolf can be a danger to even the most hardy of explorers due to its speed, crushing bite, and sometimes, it's appetite. \
	The great wolves have been hunted to near extinction by poachers due to its extremely valuable hide. They are very rare, as one would expect, and generally cautious around people."
