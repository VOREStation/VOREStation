	name = "Drone - SWOOPIE XL"
	desc = "A large drone that typically wanders about maintenance or other places that are dirty, mindlessly sucking \
	up everything it deems to be debris, trash or a pest. \
	It looks like a blue and yellow long-necked bird with a large distinct black, plump belly and flexible neck that \
	bulges with every object it swoops. \
	They tend to run on extremely basic AI until proper ones are available to be downloaded from an external, \
	oddly spooky, provider. \
	<br><br>\
	The SWOOPIE's belly and neck are made of a synthetic rubber compound that is durable enough to allow them to pack \
	away even the most fiesty of pests once they make it past the synthbird's beak, and staring into that beak would allow \
	one to see far down into the drone, though the frequent curving of the SWOOPIE's neck often makes seeing down \
	the entire length next to impossible even with a cooperative unit, let alone the passive suction that threatens to \
	make anything that gets too close to the bot's beak vanish down the drone's stretchy hose throat. \
	SWOOPIE XLs are equipped with powerful CHURNO-VAC digestive chambers that are able to effectively melt down most \
	anything that gets claimed by their vac-beaks, indescriminately melting anything that happens to end up in that chamber, \
	it would be a terrible idea to allow yourself get swooped by one of these drones, unless you want to add to their biofuel reserves."
