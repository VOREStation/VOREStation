Four metal legs extend out of its sides, The two in the front are larger than the back; and all of the legs are segmented with a unique steel looking metal. In the middle of this monstrosity is a constantly tremmoring eye. While the eye never blinks, it is dyed faintly yellow, with a vertical, read pupil. It seems like it's crying, a weird, oil like liquid seeping from its socket."
