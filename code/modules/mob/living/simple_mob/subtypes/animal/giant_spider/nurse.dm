	and it belongs to the 'Nurse' caste. \
	The spider has a beige coloration, with green eyes. \
	<br><br>\
	Nurses primarily spin webs and lay eggs for the other spiders, making them a critical role \
	for the survival of their species in their local area. Despite this importance, they are \
	(compared to the other spiders) rather frail and weak, thus requiring protection from the \
	other spiders. Laying eggs requires considerable amounts of resources, meaning Nurses generally \
	only lay eggs after they or another spider successfully hunts prey.\
	<br><br>\
	Unlike ordinary spiders, Nurses can create vast amounts of web in a short period of time, making \
	their nest difficult and dangerous to move around in. Their webs also sometimes obscure what is \
	behind them, giving an advantage to spiders defending their nest, and invoking paranoia in humans \
	tasked with exterminating the spiders. \
	<br><br>\
	Nurse venom causes fatigue and tiredness. They are also able to directly inject spider eggs into \
	those it bites, which can later hatch spiderlings, causing considerably physical and psychological trauma."
