	The spider is green, with a 'cloak' of webs attached to it. It's eyes are also green. \
	<br><br>\
	Webslingers are more aggressive than some of the other spiders in their caste, spinning web to use \
	as an offensive weapon, however they still serve a 'support' role to the other spiders. \
	They sling balls of web at prey in order to slow them down, making it easier for other spiders to catch them. \
	This makes them more dangerous when paired with others, as fleeing may stop being an option once webbed. \
	<br><br>\
	Their venom is known to make bitten prey hallucinate, greatly compromising their combat ability."
