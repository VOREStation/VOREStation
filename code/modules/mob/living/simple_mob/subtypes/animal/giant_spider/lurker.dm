// Lurkers are somewhat similar to Hunters, however the big difference is that Lurkers have an imperfect cloak.
// Their AI will try to do hit and run tactics, striking the enemy when its "cloaked", for bonus damage and a stun.
// They keep attacking until the stun ends, then retreat to cloak again and repeat the cycle.
// Hitting the spider before it does its ambush attack will break the cloak and make the spider flee.

	and it belongs to the 'Hunter' caste. \
	The spider is colored white, however it is more often seen being translucent. It has red eyes. \
	<br><br>\
	Lurkers are well known for being able to become almost entirely transparent, making them difficult \
	to see to those distracted or with poor sight. They primarily hunt by sneaking up to unsuspecting prey, \
	then ambushing them with a single powerful strike to incapacitate, before going for the kill. \
	Their translucent state appears to require some form of active management, as they become fully visible \
	after their surprise strike, or if they are harmed while translucent. Lurkers have \
	a conservative and opportunistic hunting style, fleeing into the shadows if their translucent cloak is compromised \
	from observant prey, or if their prey is still alive after their initial ambush. \

	The venom from this spider can cause confusion to those afflicted."
