	and it belongs to the 'Guard' caste. \
	The spider is colored orange, both body and eyes.\
	<br><br>\
	Compared to the other spiders in its caste, it has less strength and resilience, but instead has \
	an adaptation to more easily survive in high temperature environments. This was discovered when a group of \
	humans had an infestation of these, and their plan to \"kill it with fire\" failed.\
	<br><br>\
	The venom Thermic spiders use is very dangerous and unconventional, as it injects a liquid that combusts very \
	easily, even when inside of another living organism. The result is a gruesome death from literally burning from \
	the inside out."
