	and it belongs to the 'Guard' caste. \
	The spider is blue, and often has ice hanging off of it. It is also said to have an icy gaze, with its blue eyes. \
	<br><br>\
	It has adapted for survival in colder climates, with its body able to insulate itself from colder environments. \
	Unfortunately for it, this also has given them a vulnerability to heat.\
	<br><br>\
	Frost Spider venom causes a sharp decrease in body temperature to those bitten, which causes \
	hypothermia. It also slows down the victim, making it more difficult to escape by fleeing. \
	The danger is amplified by the fact that humans that receive the venom are often wearing \
	thermal insulating clothing, making it more difficult to warm up."
