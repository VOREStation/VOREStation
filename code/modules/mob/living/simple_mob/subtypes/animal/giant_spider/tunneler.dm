// Tunnelers have a special ability that allows them to charge at an enemy by tunneling towards them.
// Any mobs inbetween the tunneler's path and the target will be stunned if the tunneler hits them.
// The target will suffer a stun as well, if the tunneler hits them at the end. A successful hit will stop the tunneler.
// If the target moves fast enough, the tunneler can miss, causing it to overshoot.
// If the tunneler hits a solid wall, the tunneler will suffer a stun.

	name = "Giant Spider - Tunneler"
	desc = "This specific spider has been catalogued as 'Tunneler', \
	and it belongs to the 'Hunter' caste. \
	The spider has a brown appearance, perhaps as camouflage. It also often has pieces of dirt, sand, or rock lying on it. \
	Their eyes have a bright yellow shine.\
	<br><br>\
	Tunnelers generally reside in subterranean environments, as they are able to dig rapidly in soft materials.  \
	They often use this ability as an offensive tactic against prey, burrowing into the ground and tunneling, \
	towards their target, before striking them from below. This powerful tactic does have a notable flaw, \
	in that the spider is unable to actually see where they are going while burrowing, instead checking for \
	increased weight from above as a sign that their prey is above them. This flaw means that Tunnelers \
	often overshoot if the prey happens to move while it is underground, and can result in a collision if \
	the prey happened to be standing near something hard and dense. \
	<br><br>\
	Tunneler venom is also dangerous, as it is known to both promotes concentrated production of the \
	serotonin neurotransmitter, as well as causing brain damage. The feeling of happiness a bite causes \
	afterwards can delay seeking medical treatment, making it extra dangerous."
