	however what caused ordinary arachnids to evolve into these are disputed. \
	Different initial species of spider have co-evolved and interbred to produce a robust biological caste system \
	capable of producing many varieties of giant spider. They are considered by most people to be a dangerous \
	invasive species, due to their hostility, venom, and high rate of reproduction. A strong resistance to \
	various poisons and toxins has been found, making it difficult to indirectly control their population.\
	<br><br>\
	Giant Spiders have three known castes, 'Guard', 'Hunter', and 'Nurse'. \
	Spiders in the Guard caste are generally the physically stronger, resilient types. \
	The ones in the Hunter caste are usually faster, or have some from of ability to \
	close the distance between them and their prey rapidly. \
	Finally, those in the Nurse caste generally act in a supporting role to the other two \
	castes, spinning webs and ensuring their nest grows larger and more terrifying."
