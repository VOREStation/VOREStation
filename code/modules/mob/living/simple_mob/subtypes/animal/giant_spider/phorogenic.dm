	desc = "This specific spider has been catalogued as 'Phorogenic', \
	and it belongs to the 'Guard' caste. \
	The spider has a purple, crystalline appearance, with their eyes also purple.\
	<br><br>\
	These spiders are very dangerous, and unusual. They have obviously been influenced by the mysterious \
	material known as phoron, however it is not known if this is the result of arachnids merely being \
	exposed to naturally-occuring phoron on some alien world, being genetically altered to produce phoron by an unknown party, \
	or some other unknown cause. \
	<br><br>\
	Compared to the other types of spiders in their caste, and even to those outside, this one is the \
	peak of physical strength. It is very strong, often capable of killing its prey in one or two bites, \
	with unyielding endurance to match. It also injects trace amounts of liquid phoron into its victim, \
	which is very toxic to most organic life known. \
	<br><br>\
	Phorongenic spiders are also highly explosive, due to their infusion with phoron. \
	Should one die, it will create a large explosion. This appears to be an automatic response \
	caused from internal rupturing, as opposed to an intentional act of revenge by the spider, however \
	the result is the same, oftening ending a fight with both sides dead."
