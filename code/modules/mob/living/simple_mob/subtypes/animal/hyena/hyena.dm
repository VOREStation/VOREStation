	It is primarily a hunter but may also scavenge, with the capacity to eat and digest skin, bone and other animal waste. \
	The spotted hyena displays greater plasticity in its hunting and foraging behaviour than other similar carnivores; \
	it hunts alone, in small parties of 2â€“5 individuals or in large groups. \
	During a hunt, spotted hyenas often run through ungulate herds in order to select an individual to attack. \
	Once selected, their prey is chased over a long distance, often several kilometres, at speeds of up to 60 km/h."
