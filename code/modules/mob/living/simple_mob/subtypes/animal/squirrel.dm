	to have long, extremely bushy tails. Squirrels have been spread through space primarily by accident when they sneak aboard landed vessels. \
	While squirrels can live in many places, they thrive in temperate environments with a seasonal cycle. They seem to be almost hard wired to follow \
	the seasons, shedding fur in the spring, gathering food and packing on weight in autumn, and hybernating in winter. They may still attempt to follow \
	these cycles even in places without seasons, which can be stressful to them. Life in space and on the various worlds they now inhabit has over time \
	changed the humble squirrel, as with a more extreme lifestyle, they have adapted to endure much harsher climates and threats in the autumn and winter months."
