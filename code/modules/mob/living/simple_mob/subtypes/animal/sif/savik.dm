	<br><br>\
	A predatory warm-blooded reptillian species covered in a layer of insulating down feathers. \
	The Savik's preferred method of hunting is to burrow under deep snow drifts, and lie in ambush for prey. \
	The Savik has been known to lie in wait for days at a time, generating heat by vibrating its shoulder plates \
	at a nigh inperceptable frequency while most of its body enters a state of sopor in order to conserve energy. \
	<br><br>\
	Once the Savik detects its prey, it will charge with incredible kinetic force with the two enormous, \
	angled bony plates on either side of the Savik's upper body acting as a natural snow plow, \
	allowing frightening ease of movement through deep snow. Due to the long periods between feeding, \
	the Savik will hunt its prey with absolute perseverence, as failure to catch a suitable meal is likely to \
	spell death for the animal due to the high energy expenditure of its initial strike. \
	The Savik has no known predators, and should be avoided at all costs."
