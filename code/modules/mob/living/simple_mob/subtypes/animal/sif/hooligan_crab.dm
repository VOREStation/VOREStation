/*
	Hooligan Crabs are called so because they are rather curious and tend to follow people,
	whether the people want them to or not, and sometimes causing vandalism by accident.
	They're pretty strong and have strong melee armor, but won't attack first.
	They unknowingly play a role in keeping the shoreline fairly safe, by killing whatever would attack other people.

	They also have a slow, but very strong attack that is telegraphed. If it hits, it will briefly stun whatever got hit
	and inflict a very large chunk of damage. If the thing was already stunned, the crab will 'throw' them away, to
	hopefully prevent chainstuns forever.

	often following people around, and occasionally stealing man-made objects, hence their name. \
	They generally reside at the shoreline in small groups, situated between two sources of food for it, \
	small marine life in the ocean, and small plant matter near the shore. Larger lifeforms such as humans \
	are left alone, however they will not hesitate to fight back if provoked.\
	<br><br>\
	Hooligans have a characteristic grey shell that is very thick and protective, allowing them to \
	shrug off nearby attacks from both predators and reckless humans. It pairs its excellent defense with slow, but \
	powerful offensive, utilizing its weight and size to crush and throw threats. As such, predators generally avoid \
	Hooligan shorelines."
