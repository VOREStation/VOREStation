	<br><br>\
	Small, asocial omnivores with glistening, razor-thin feathers valued for their use as a reflective glitter by poachers. \
	The Crystal-Feather Duck commonly forms at most a familial group of four, a male, two females, and a single 'chosen' young. Primarily detrivorous browsers, \
	supplementing their diet with animals living below thinner shore ice-sheets. \
	Family units have been observed to form gangs and scavenge from Sivian domeciles and \
	various food transports during stressful months. \
	It is advised to seal and hide any form of food near even lone individuals, as they will become \
	increasingly aggressive in order to acquire it."
