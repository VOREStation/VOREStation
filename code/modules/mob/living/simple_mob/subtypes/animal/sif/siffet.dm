	<br><br>\
	The Siffet, or Sivian Frost Weasel is a small, solitary predator known for its striking ability to take down prey up to twice their size. \
	The majority of the Siffet's adult life is spent in isolation, prowling large territories in Sif's tundra regions, \
	only seeking out other individuals during the summer mating season, when deadly battles for dominance are common. \
	Though mostly docile towards adult humans and other large sapients, the Siffet has been known to target children and smaller species as prey, \
	and a provoked Siffet can be a danger to even the most experienced handler due to its quick movement and surprisingly powerful jaws. \
	The Siffet is sometimes hunted for its remarkably soft pelt, though most is obtained through fur farming."
