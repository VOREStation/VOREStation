	<br><br>\
	A meter-long fuzzy insect from the planet Binma. \
	A native of the Binman contintents of Telarus and Dalomee, the Tymisian Moth usually lives in communal \
	groups of upwards of thirty individuals, known as 'spuzzes', and typically breeds up to three times in its \
	fifteen year natural lifespan. \
	<br>\
	Though strictly herbivorous, the moth has an acute sense of smell which it uses to detect potential predators. \
	Impressively, the moth secretes an oily substance which it uses to coat collected material stored in 'soft pockets' \
	beneath each wing, which in turn attracts colonies of pungent bacteria. \
	When threatened, the moth will release this dust, which has a disorienting effect on most Binman species, as well as all known sapients. \
	<br>\
	The Tymisian Moth is considered an invasive species on Sif, and is believed to have been established from an illegally \
	released pet collection. Though less dangerous than in its native environment, the moth has nonetheless established a \
	similar symbiotic relationship with Sivian bacteria for its defense mechanism, and is still to be considered quite dangerous. \
	<br>\
	As an invasive species, individuals encountering the Tymisian Moth on Sif are requested to report the sighting to local wildlife \
	services, and remove or destroy the creature if it is safe to do so."
