	The Shantak is easily recognized by its iridescent, crystaline mane. \
	The creature's specially adapted hairs are hardened by a natural hard mineral coating, \
	thickest in the mane but present across the whole body. \
	As well as giving the Shantak a coat nigh-inpenetrable to all but the most specialized predator, \
	their hard, almost metallic coat gives them a slightly musical accent as they move. \
	The Shantak uses its powerful foreclaws for both den-building and foraging. \
	<br><br>\
	Observed to share several square-mile territories with a small number of other individuals, \
	the Shantak will rotate between several dens dug deep into the hard earth throughout the year, \
	while deftly avoiding others of its species outwith mating season. While other wildlife makes use of these dens, \
	the Shantak is fiercely territorial and will defend itself against any creature it perceives as a threat with reckless abandon. \
	Their diet consists primarily of fungi and insects found just below the permafrost."
