	<br><br>\
	A 10 inch long, hard-shelled insect with a natural adaption to living around terrestrial lava vents. \
	The fire bug's hard shell offers extremely effective protection against most threats, \
	though the species is almost completely docile, and will prefer to continue grazing on its diet of volcanic micro-flora \
	rather than defend itself in most situations.\
	<br>\
	The fire bug is a curiosity to most on the frontier, offering little in the way of meaningful food or resources, \
	though at least one Sivian fashion designer has used their iridescent red shells to create striking, hand-made garments."
