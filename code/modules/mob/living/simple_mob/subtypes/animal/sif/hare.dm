	<br><br>\
	Hard-skinned, horned herbivores common on the glacial regions of Sif. \
	The Ice Hare lives in colonies of up to thirty individuals dug beneath thick ice sheets for protection from many burrowing predators. \
	Their diet consists of mostly moss and lichens, though this is supplemented with the consumption of hard mineral pebbles, which it swallows whole, \
	which form the small, hard, 'ice-like' scales of the animal. \
	The Ice Hare is almost completely harmless to sapients, with relatively blunt claws and a weak jaw. Its main forms of self-defense are its speed, \
	and two sharp head spikes whose 'ear-like' appearance gave the species its common name."
