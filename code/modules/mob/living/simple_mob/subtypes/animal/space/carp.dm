	desc = "A strange descendant of some form of voidborne life, they are the most \
	common naturally void-faring lifeform found in human territory. They've been named \
	'Space Carp' by various groups of spacers due to resembling the fish from Earth.\
	<br><br>\
	Their lifecycle begins as a fungus-like growth, sometimes found on the walls of spacecraft \
	and space stations, before growing into a form which allows for independent travel. Even \
	when fully grown, they can sometimes be found to stow away on the hulls of spaceborne objects, \
	which might explain how they became widespread across many star systems.\
	<br><br>\
	Carp have a special gas bladder inside of them, which they utilize as a means of movement in \
	space by stategically releasing the gas to propel themselves in a process that resembles \
	thrusters on a spacecraft. The gas contained inside the carp also allows them \
	to float when inside an atmosphere. The carp might also spray 'spores' using a similar method.\
	<br><br>\
	They are hypercarnivorous to the point of cannibalism, consuming their own dead in order to \
	sustain themselves during hard times, which are rather frequent due to their prey being \
	vastly technologically advanced. For human habitats that are well secured, carp are generally \
	an annoyance. For those unable to adequately protect themselves, however, they can be \
	rather dangerous, especially if a mass migration of carp arrives."
