	the 'space ray' is a somewhat horrifying-looking creature with a maw of sharp fangs \
	and several vicious-looking bony protrusions.\
	<br><br>\
	In truth, however, they are largely harmless creatures, being content to drift \
	upon the solar winds. They seem to feed off a mix of interstellar gases, solar radiation, \
	space dust, and occasionally other detritus. There are no known cases of unprovoked attacks. \
	More baffling is their ability to fly within gravity fields, as they do not seem to move about \
	in the same way that carp do, instead seeming to drift on invisible field currents. \
	<br><br>\
	Scientists have found several shared genetic markers between both the 'ray' and 'carp', \
	but at this time have little direct evidence of any relationship between these species. \
	There are many competing theories, and few of them can agree on anything but the broadest \
	strokes. Oh, and that their tissues contain considerable amounts of soporifics. That too. \
	<br><br>\
	What scientists can agree on, however, is that whilst the 'space ray' may look nasty \
	they're generally little threat. Astroxenobiologists have noted that the two species do \
	seem to get along quite poorly, and that the rays are quite capable of dispatching their \
	supposed cousins, even when outnumbered."
