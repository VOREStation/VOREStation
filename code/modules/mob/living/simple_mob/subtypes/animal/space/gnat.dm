	The so-called 'space gnat' is a populous and highly irritating but largely harmless threat \
	mostly known for how much of a nuisance it poses by flying into various intakes and other \
	sensitive or delicate starship components. Their small, spherical bodies are very fragile \
	and possess four stubby wings that serve no apparent purpose, but which the gnats flap furiously \
	all the same, perhaps in anger at the cruelties of life and the universe.\

	Indeed, what kind of god could create such a misbegotten creature? Certainly not a benevolent one."
