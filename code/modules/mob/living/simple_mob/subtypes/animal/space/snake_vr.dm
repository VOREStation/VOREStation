	<br><br>\
	Snakes are elongated, limbless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes \
	Like all other squamates, pythons are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. \
	Many species of snake have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, \
	enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. \
	<br>\
	This type of snake is nonvenomous and use their slender bodies to primarily subdue their prey. \
	Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill them by constriction - this is dependant on the prey. \
	<br>\
	Snakes are mostly passive - however they will attack if threatened - it is recommended that \
	persons keep their distance as to not provoke these animals."
