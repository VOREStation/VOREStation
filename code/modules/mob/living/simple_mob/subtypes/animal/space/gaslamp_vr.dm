/*
LORE:
Gaslamps are a phoron-based life form endemic to the world of Virgo-3B. They are
a sort of fungal organism with physical ties to Diona and Vox, deriving energy
for movement from a gentle combustion-like reaction in their bodies using
atmospheric phoron, carefully filtered trace oxygen, and captured meat products.
Over-exposure to oxygen causes their insides to burn too hot and eventually
kills them.

TODO: Make them light up and heat the air when exposed to oxygen.

Struggle as you might now, it is too late to deny the jellyfish-esque scavenger its lucky catch; inch by inch, the gaslamp tugs you upwards into its equivalent of a stomach, the transition between the cool-to-frigid atmosphere on the outside to its surprising internal heat something you can feel through any outer wear you possess. Minutes pass, soon resulting in the gentle creature's body sporting a rounded, bulging swell, an indistinct shadow shifting and twitching inside it as you squirm about. Be it to escape or simply to get settled, you might want to take care, however. The gaslamp's internal chamber is slick and squishy instead of overly oppressive, yet, each wave of warmth that pulses over you leaves you feeling weaker than the last..."

		"Occasionally, a soft glow mutedly shines through the gaslamp and into its prey-filled insides, whenever it drifts close to something bright... yet, it always fades back into warm, slick darkness.",
