	No one, not scientist or wildlife expert can properly explain these spacial skeletons with any solid \
	certanty. They are not human, despite the clear simularites to a human's skeleton, nor are they made of \
	calcium like normal bones. Samples taken from the corpses of these strange creatures have yieled little \
	in the form of answers and have only raised more questions with regards to their general existence. \
	Scientist are still studying these beings, a difficult task as they are difficult to come by in the \
	vaccum of space. The only information that scientist are able to gather about these so-called 'Space \
	Skeletons' as people have come to call them is that their structure is comprised of a strange cell \
	structure that is similar to plants - likely because these creatures are known to feed of the UV \
	rays of nearby stars."
