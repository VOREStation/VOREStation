			This space jellyfish uses hypnotic patterns to lure in prey, which it then wraps in tentacles to leech energy from.\
			It is somewhat weak, but uses unknown means to stun prey. It uses the energy of its prey to replicate itself. \
			These creatures can quickly grow out of control if left to feed and reproduce unchecked. \
			Notable weakness to rapid cooling from ice based weaponry.\
			The flesh is typically non-toxic and quite delicious. Their cores are considered a delicacy in many regions."
