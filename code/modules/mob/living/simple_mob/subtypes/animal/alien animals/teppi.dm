//I made these up. They aren't deliberately based on, or supposed to be anything in particular.
//They came out kind of goat-ish but that wasn't intentional. I was just going for some cute thing you could
//take care of and/or kill for meat.
//I made them to be a part of the 'low tech survival' part of the game. You can use them to obtain a relatively
//unlimited amount of meat, wool, hide, bone, and COMPANIONSHIP without the need for machines or power... hopefully.
//There's no real story behind them, they're semi-intelligent wild alien animals with a somewhat mild temperament.
//They'll beat you up if you're mean to them, they have preferences for food, affection, and the ability
//to form opinions of others. Or as close to those things as I could get with my tiny creature brain and byond.
//They're TOUGH, but pretty easy to exploit for your needs if you pay attention to them and use your head.
//They also come in a variety of colors and markings, and those factors can be kind of manipulated through controlled breeding.
//They basically do all their funny things based on nutrition, so, if you feed them and like, put them near eachother
//they do what they do when they feel like it.

//Also they eat you and all their vore related text is custom because I'm a shameless vore idiot
//And their stomach defaults to drain, so, dunking people into there will actually help them out without (immediately) killing people SO LIKE
//you know. Feed people to them or whatever, it's cool. People getting eaten has a tangible positive mechanical impact. So do it.

/////////////////TO DO (if I ever learn how/someone ever feels like it)//////////////////////////////
//>seek food nearby to eat, including players with the appropriate settings.
//>give baby teppi a holder thingy so you can pick them up and carry them around
//>give adult teppi the ability to be ridden at high affinity
//>give adult teppi the ability to be equipped with a bag or something, so they can carry things for you
//>baby teppi can ventcrawl when AI controlled (so they fade out, and then appear at a random vent on the Z level)
//>make it so that teppi size is a thing that can be influenced by breeding
//>make it so the teppi are better at following people they really like around without also disabling the other things that their AI does (like resting and speaking)
//>make it so that teppi gains affinity for feeding people to them WITHOUT ALSO introducing a way for people to game the system by spamclicking
//>make it so that when feeding people to the teppi you don't get a choice where to send them unless the teppi is controlled by the player (since they have a special interaction for choosing where to send people that they eat)

	Unlike many horned mammals, Teppi have developed paws with four toes rather than hooves.\
	This coupled with a thick, powerful tail makes them quite capable and balanced on many\
	kinds of terrain. A recently discovered species, their origins are something of a\
	mystery, but they have been discovered in more different regions of space with no apparent\
	connection to one another. Teppi are known to reproduce and grow rather quickly, which if\
	left unchecked can lead to serious problems for local ecology.\
	Teppi are very hardy, engaging them in combat is not recommended.\
	Teppi can be a good source of protein and materials for crafts and clothing in emergency\
	situations. They are not especially picky eaters, and have a rather mild temperament.\
	A pair of well fed Teppi can rather quickly become a small horde, so it is generally\

Beyond that there are other organs unseen, glooping and churning and glorgling outside of your chamber, then there are layers of muscle and bone, and finally a thick hide and ample fluff. This all means that, for your part, you’re likely a small shifting shape under that fluffy exterior, packed away deep at the core of all of those layers, so far from the outside world as that chamber grinds and smothers over you, smearing you in slime and keeping you nice and tucked deep into the rumbling darkness.")

You can pull your limbs out from between the heavy meaty folds with some effort, and when you do there’s a messy sucking noise in the wake of the motion. Of course, such a disturbance naturally warrants that the chamber would redouble its efforts to subdue you and smother you in those thick tingling slimes.",

After several long moments held in the tight embrace of that pulsing flesh, things ease up a bit again and resume their insistent, tingly churnings.",

As you sink into %pred’s body, it becomes harder and harder to identify where you end and %pred begins, and that pumping heartbeat lulls your mind into something of a dull haze.",
