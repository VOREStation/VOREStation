	Combat drones have a rapid ranged attack, and have a projectile shield.
	They are rather slow, but attempt to 'kite' its target.
	A solid hit with an EMP grenade will kill the shield instantly.

	desc = "Deadly to anyone it perceives as an enemy, this drone model tries to capture the ideal balance \
	between effectiveness, versatility, and expendability. It possesses sophisticated technology that allows it \
	to both be dangerous, and be less costly to build compared to alternatives such as exosuits. It was designed \
	for combat in space, however they are also able to function inside a gravity well, due to a favorable \
	thrust-to-weight ratio.\
	<br><br>\
	One notable feature of this model is its ability to rapidly fire lasers at the target. This is accomplished \
	with its array of lasers installed on the left and right side of the drone, with each side housing three \
	laser emitters. The drone cycles between the six different emitters each time it fires a laser, in order to avoid \
	overheating before the integrated heatsinks are able to remove the heat, \
	thus allowing for a higher than average rate of fire. This ability allows for the drone to act in a suppressive \
	manner against personnel, or to provide a general 'shock and awe' factor when swarms of drones are firing at once.\
	<br><br>\
	The drone's frame is lightweight, as required due to the type of thrusters integrated into the frame. \
	Unfortunately, this comes at the cost of being less sturdy. To counteract this vulnerability, the \
	drone has an integrated shield projector, which is tuned to allow the shield to intercept projectiles, \
	while allowing its own lasers to pass through unaffected.\
	<br><br>\
	Despite these qualities, one significant flaw this model has, is that its source of energy is considerably \
	less powerful than what is standard, which cuts into the amount of energy that can go into both the lasers and the shields. \
	Generally, the solution to this flaw is to add more drones until it doesn't matter anymore."
