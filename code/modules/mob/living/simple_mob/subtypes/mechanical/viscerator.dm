	which it uses both to fly and to attack enemy targets. Their simple construction generally \
	means that if one is found, a swarm of others are not too far away.\
	<br><br>\
	They are most effective against soft targets such as unarmored personnel, as the propeller \
	tends to get deflected after slicing into someone's flesh, and as such they tend to not cut deeply. \
	The simplistic AI inside compensates for this by using the tendency to bounce away after \
	slicing as an evasive tactic to avoid harm. This allows the viscerator to cut up the target, \
	fly to the side, and then repeat, potentially causing the target to die from many seperate wounds."
