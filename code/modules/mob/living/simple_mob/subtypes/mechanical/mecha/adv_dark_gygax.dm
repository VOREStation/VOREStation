	name = "Exosuit - Advanced Dark Gygax"
	desc = "This exosuit is an experimental prototype, descended from the Dark Gygax. It retains the \
	speed that is characteristic of the other models, yet outclasses all of them in durability, \
	to the point of having a comparable amount of protection to models that placed a higher emphesis \
	on armor, like the Durand and even the Marauder. It is also much larger in scale, and significantly \
	heavier than most other exosuits developed by humans, which often causes shockwaves to be felt \
	whenever it moves. This has been observed to have a demoralizing effect on hostile forces.\
	<br><br>\
	<b>Weapons & Power System</b><br>\
	Attached to the exosuit's chassis are several newly invented mounted weapons, each unique in purpose and capability. \
	These weapons are integral to the chassis as opposed to the modular equipment that more traditional exosuits utilize. \
	It is unknown if that is due to simply being an early prototype, or if discarding the modular design is benefitial \
	to the design of the model.\
	<br><br>\
	All the weapons utilize energy, as opposed to consumable projectiles. This appears to have been a conscious decision to \
	allow for more staying power, by only being limited by availablity of electricity. \
	In order to supply the needed energy for combat, the ADG contains a miniturized fusion reactor, which is also \
	considered experimental due to its size. The reactor is powerful enough to power the actuators, electronics, \
	and the primary weapon. The supplementary weapons, however, cannot be continiously fired and instead draw from \
	a electrical buffer that is constantly replenished by the reactor.\
	<br><br>\
	<b>Homing Energy Bolts</b><br>\
	The primary weapon is a projector that fires somewhat slow moving blue bolts of energy. The ADG is able to \
	passively redirect the trajectory of the blue bolts towards the initial target, essentially acting as a \
	homing projectile. The blue bolt itself is otherwise not very powerful compared to conventional photonic \
	weaponry or ballistic shells, however the power required to fire the main gun is significantly less \
	than the other available weapons, and so the ADG uses it as the main weapon.\
	<br><br>\
	<b>Self-Supplying Missile Launcher</b><br>\
	The first supplementary weapon would appear to not be an energy weapon, as it is a missile launcher. \
	What is not obvious is that the missiles are fabricated inside the exosuit, with the physical \
	materials also being created from energy, similar to the newer models of Rapid Construction Devices. \
	Therefore, the ADG does not need to concern itself with running out of missiles. The missiles themselves \
	are optimized towards harming hard targets, such as other exosuits, but are also still dangerous to soft \
	targets like infantry.\
	<br><br>\
	<b>Electric Defense</b><br>\
	The second supplementary weapon is not a conventional gun. Instead, the ADG weaponizes its electrical \
	systems by redirecting power output from its fusion reactor to its exterior shell, becoming a walking \
	tesla coil. This generates a strong electric field that harms anything unprotected nearby. \
	The electric field grows in power, until reaching a critical point, after which a blinding flash \
	of light and arcs of lightning fly out from the exosuit towards its surroundings.\
	<br><br>\
	<b>Microsingularity Projector</b><br>\
	Finally, the third supplementary weapon utilizes gravitation as a weapon, by firing a blue energetic orb \
	that, upon hitting the ground, collapses and causes a 'microsingularity' to emerge briefly, pulling in \
	anything unsecured, such as personnel or weapons. The microsingularity lacks the means to gain any energy, meaning it \
	will dissipate in a few seconds, and so it is <u>probably</u> safe to use on a planetary body.\
	<br><br>\
	<b>Flaws</b><br>\
	It would appear the ADG is poised to take the place of other exosuits like the Marauder, however several \
	massive flaws exist to make that unlikely. Firstly, this exosuit is almost an order of magnitude more \
	costly to produce than comparable alternatives, even accounting for being a prototype. \
	Secondly, a number of weapons integrated into the ADG are dangerous both to enemies and \
	allies, limiting the ability for a massed assault using ADGs. \
	Finally, the nature of several weapons used could invoke technological fear, or otherwise \
	be considered a war crime to utilize, primarily the electrical field and microsingularity \
	projector.\
	<br><br>\
	All of these flaws appear to doom the ADG to becoming another technological marvel that was \
	overly ambitious and unconstrained to the demands of reality. They will likely be really rare, \
	and terrifying."
