	During the First Contact War against the Unathi, there was a need for various new technologies to be developed \
	to counter the Unathi war machine. One of many solutions created was the Durand, which was made to be heavy and \
	well-armored, and be capable of powering the various weapons that could be mounted onto it. Presently, the \
