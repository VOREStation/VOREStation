	and sometimes one or two passengers, with the right modifications made. \
	Hoverpods have existed for a very long time, and the design has remained more or less consistant over its life. \
	They carved out a niche in short ranged transportation of cargo or crew while in space, \
	as they were more efficient compared to using a shuttle, and required less infrastructure to use due to being compact enough \
	to use airlocks. As such, they acted as a sort of bridge between being EVA in a spacesuit, and being inside a 'real' spacecraft.\

	In recent times, the Hoverpod is seen as outdated by some, as newer solutions to that niche now exist, however it remains an ancient favorite."
