	desc = "A drone that walks on several legs, with yellow/gold armor plating. It appears to lack a specific weapon, \
	but uses a regular bullet-type weapon, firing a single projectile with a delay. Once upon a time, these bots may \
	have been used to be some sort of... security, or defensive machinery, at a guess, but their original/true purpose is \
	unclear. Whatever the matter, they're hostile and will engage anything they see, shooting to kill."
