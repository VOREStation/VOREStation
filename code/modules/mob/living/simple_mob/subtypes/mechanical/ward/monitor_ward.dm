/*
	'Monitor' wards are drones that yell at their creator if they see someone besides them that they are hostile to.
	They can also force an invisible entity to uncloak if the invisible mob is hostile to the ward.
	If AI controlled, they will also warn their faction if they see a hostile entity, acting as floating cameras.

	purpose is simply to observe the environment around it, reacting when it detects entities \
	it judges to be unfriendly. It presumably relays information about what it sees back to \
	whoever owns the drone.\
	<br><br>\
	The sensors onboard the ward are much more advanced than what is typical for drones, \
	allowing it to detect entities that might otherwise go unnoticed by inferior \
	observers. If this ward sees such a thing, it fires a beam of energy at the hidden \
	entity, which exposes them."
