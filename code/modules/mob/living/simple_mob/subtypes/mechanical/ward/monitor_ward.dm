/*
	'Monitor' wards are drones that yell at their creator if they see someone besides them that they are hostile to.
	They can also force an invisible entity to uncloak if the invisible mob is hostile to the ward.
	If AI controlled, they will also warn their faction if they see a hostile entity, acting as floating cameras.
