	The drone has pristine armor, black and shiny, with the blue synth-parts glowing visibly from inside.\
	<br><br>\
	The drone's frame is heavy and armored, unbendable by hand, is barren of any markings or ID,\
	no traces of paint visible and any 'writing' visible is uncomprehendable, short term scan unable to translate."
