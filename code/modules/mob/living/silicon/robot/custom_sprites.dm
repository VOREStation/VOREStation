// To summarize, if you want to add a whitelisted borg sprite, you have to
// 1. Add ckey and character name to config/custom_sprites, separated by a |
// 2. Add your custom sprite to custom_synthetic.dmi under icon/mob/custom_synthetic.dmi
// 3. Name the sprite, and all of its components, as ckey-charname-module
// Note that, due to the last couple lines of code, your sprite may appear invisible until you select a module.
// You can fix this by adding a 'standard' configuration, or you could probably just ignore it if you're lazy.
