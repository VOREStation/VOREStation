	The crystals themselves are completely inert, suggesting that they do not adjust the climate they \
	are found in, instead being acted on by their local surroundings at the time of formation. Crystals \
	retain their characteristics when moved, even to a location with an 'opposite' environment to the one \
	it was found in, suggesting that locations where clusters are found have had a fairly consistant environment \
	for a very long time.\
	<br><br>\
	Unfortunately, no useful purpose has been found so far for the crystals, beyond being visually pleasing \
	to observe. They would likely be valued by jewelers, if it wasn't very difficult to work with the crystal."
