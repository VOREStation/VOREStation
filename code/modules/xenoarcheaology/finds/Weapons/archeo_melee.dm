/// Modified version of the cultblade that xenoarch spawned.
/// This is a usuable version that isn't just a trap if you find it and try to use it on a mob.
/// Has some spooky effects, damages you as you use it (which fuels the sword) and can really hurt if overused.
/// And if you feed it enough, it allows the sword to do some special spawns.
/// Melee has always been a VERY underused thing and guns are EXTREMELY strong comparitively.
/// Thus, this gives the xenoarch a few choices when finding this:
/// Give it to R&D to deconstruct, use it to fight mobs off near artifact sites, give it to people exploring space, or keep it to summon more artifacts.
/// If you DO decide to use it and then give it to R&D...Well...Either you or whoever puts it into the deconstructor is going to have a BAD time.
