					Zoroastrianism is one of the world's oldest founded religions. Founded about 4000 years ago in what is now known as Iran, it was one of the first religions to preach monotheism, and is considered the inspiration for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
					<br><br>
					Zoroastrianism was founded by the prophet, Zoroaster. Zoroaster was a priest in an area that preached mostly polytheistic religions. He rejected these beliefs, mostly because they were used to classify people in a rigid social structure with priests controlling the ordinary people. One day, while bathing in a river, Zoroaster received a vision from God.
					<br><br>
					Zoroaster reportedly found the visions of a God named Ahura Mazda, or the <i>"Wise Lord"</i>. Ahura Mazda came down to Zoroaster in the form of his Amesha Spentas, or <i>"Divine Immortals"</i>. This experience changed his worldview, and he sought to spread his religion through the lands. Despite some struggles, he was successful in that the Persian Empire picked up his beliefs, and spread them far and wide (but did not do so forcefully).
					<br><br>
					Zoroastrianism is a simple religion. There is one God, Ahura Mazda. He is omnipotent, omnipresent, and the force behind all creation. His six Amesha Spentas are representations of himself in various aspects and forms. An analogy to think of is that he is the sun, and they are all rays of the sun. Ahura Mazda is opposed by a devil named Angra Mainyu, or the <i>"Destructive Spirit"</i>. While Ahura Mazda seeks to create life and beauty, Angra Mainyu only seeks to destroy his greatness and glory at every turn.

					There are three pillars of Zoroastrianism for all followers to practice. Simply put: they are good thoughts, good words, and good deeds. By following all three of these pillars to the best of your abilities, Ahura Mazda blessed you with a life of immortality in the next life, where you'll spend your times happily in paradise.
					<br><br>
					Dualism plays an important role in the beliefs of a Zoroastrian. Ahura Mazda is good, while Angra Mainyu is evil. He is the sun, while she is the moon. Day and night, fire and water, life and death. The struggle between these two creates balance. However, one cannot be understood without the other. There is no day without night, no warmth if there is never cold, and so on. A balance must always exist.
					<br><br>
					Happiness and sadness are also important to balance. Happiness is found by following Ahura Mazda's light, while sadness is found by giving in to the demons of Angra Mainyu. Heaven and Hell, the decision must be made by every man. Zoroastrianism appeases to the good in men, claiming that overall, mankind is of good nature, and will eventually triumph over evil.
					<br><br>
					Funerals in Zoroastrian culture are rather usual. The corpse of the deceased is considered unholy, and a work of evil. To put this evil in contact with nature would corrupt the goodness of nature. As such, burials are strictly prohibited. The bodies of the dead are typically either preserved in stone tombs or mausoleums, or in sky towers of stone. These methods of funerals are increasingly inconvenient in the modern age, and thus, many Zoroastrians opt for cremation instead.
					<br><br>
					There are no specific rituals for prayer, or how often a prayer must be commenced every day. But all that is demanded is that the faithful pray to Ahura Mazda every day. If possible, they may pray to a candle or a fire, as the fire represents his warmth and guidance.

				The more they stared, the brighter she became, till finally she became so bright that the people were blinded by her radiance and could no longer look up. This suited the shy Hae-soon and she continued to glow brightly from then on.

				One day, Goddess Parvathi, the wife of Lord Shiva, was getting ready for her bath and needed someone to guard her chamber.<br><br>
				Therefore she made a beautiful, young boy from the sandalwood from her body. She gave him life by sprinkling the Holy Ganges water on him and entrusted him with guarding the door.<br><br>
				While she was away, Lord Shiva returned and was surprised to find a little boy standing at the entrance to his wife's chamber. When he tried to enter, the boy blocked his path. <br><br>
				"Who are you and why are you blocking my path?" demanded Lord Shiva.<br><br>
				"No one enters my mother's chamber," declared the boy boldly.<br><br>
				Taken aback, Lord Shiva replied, "Step away; I have the right to enter my wife's chamber."<br><br>
				But the young and courageous boy did not move but stood his ground.<br><br>
				Not knowing that this was his own son, Lord Shiva who was quick to anger grew enraged. Not used to be disobeyed he cut off the boy's head.<br><br>
				Goddess Parvathi on returning from her bath saw her son lying dead and was overcome with grief. She was filled with both anger and sorrow.<br><br>
				Seeing this Lord Shiva sent his soldiers to fetch the head of the first beast that they saw. The men rushed and finally came upon an elephant. They immediately took the head to Lord Shiva, who quickly attached it onto the body of the slain boy and gave him life once again.<br><br>
				To further appease his grief-stricken wife he promised that her son would be worshiped first, before all other Gods.<br><br>
				Even today at the entrance of all temples one would find the idol of the elephant-headed God, Lord Ganesha.

				<h1>Feast of Kubera</h1>
				<p class="border">
				Kubera, god of wealth, had become arrogant. One day he decided to host an extravagant feast for the gods, such a feast as never had been hosted before. It would increase his prestige and show all men and gods the extent of his wealth and influence.<br><br>
				Accordingly, he went to Mount Kailash to invite Lord Shiva. Shiva was his patron. Kubera owed all his wealth to Shiva who, pleased with his devotion, had given him the boon that his wealth would never diminish, no matter how much he spent.<br><br>
				Shiva declined to come but said he would send his son, Ganesha. Kubera was disappointed. Shiva's presence would have been a feather in his cap. But at least he was sending Ganesha. It would have been a terrible snub if no one from the family were to come. Kubera resolved to make the feast so grand that Shiva's absence would not be felt.<br><br>
				The guests were many, thousands of them, both gods and men. They were accommodated in a huge hall built especially for the purpose. The chief guest, Ganesha, was the last to come.<br><br>
				The moment he entered, he began to ask for food. He was shown to a seat of honor and tantalizing dishes were set before him. He gulped them down and asked for more. He was given a second helping and then a third but his appetite remained undiminished.<br><br>
				Kubera ordered his army of cooks to produce more food but they could not keep pace with Ganesha's eating frenzy. The elephant-god was eating food meant for thousands. When he had finished all the food set before him, he began to shout, "Give me more, give me more!" and then getting impatiently to his feet, rushed to the enormous kitchen and devoured all the food there.<br><br>
				Kubera was aghast. All the food was gone and the guests had not been fed. Worse, Ganesha was still hungry.<br><br>
				"You call this a feast?" Ganesha admonished Kubera. "There's no food here. I'm going home."<br><br>
				Kubera pleaded with him to stay, promising him more food in a little while but his young guest was in no mood to listen. He got on his mount and sped away. Kubera, fearing Shiva's wrath, followed in his own vehicle. When he arrived at Kailash, he found Ganesha complaining loudly to his father about the lack of food at his feast.<br><br>
				"What's this I hear, Kubera?" asked Shiva, turning to the god. "No food at your feast?"<br><br>
				"I... I...," mumbled Kubera.<br><br>
				"Go in and ask your mother for some food," said Shiva to his son. "I'm sure Kubera did his best."<br><br>
				"I did, I did, my lord," said Kubera, feeling miserable. His feast had turned into a farce. Instead of adding to his prestige it had made him a laughing stock. But he was relieved to see that Shiva did not appear to be angry.<br><br>
				He fell at his patron's feet and begged forgiveness for his pride.
