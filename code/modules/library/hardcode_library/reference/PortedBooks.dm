					<br><br>
					<b>Glass Bulbs</b><br>
					Do not throw away your burnt out, broken light bulbs: collect them! These bulbs can be inserted into the nearest autolathe where their glass can be re-purposed. Broken bulbs and tubes both fit inside: just mind the sharp edges if they've been shattered.

					<b>Glass Shards</b><br>
					Did somebody break a window again? No matter, put on your welding goggles and you can re-purpose those glass shards right there on the spot by melting it down back to a more useful state.

					You would be amazed at the amount of materials that get flushed down disposals: and nearly half of it isn't garbage. People flush things down disposals all the time just to get rid of it: bags, tools, boxes. For one reason or another, some idiot in medbay has thrown away a perfectly good lab coat again. The engineer? They've thrown down an entire toolbox: empty, because they've probably stuffed its contents into their own tool belt.
					<br><br>

All these things can get organized and replaced in appropriate storage areas, but keep in mind: Some of that stuff's there for a reason, such as the emergency internals, gas masks, fire extinguishers, and flashlights. These types of objects should stay there: But if you find a bottle of liquor in a crate somewhere? Hell, why not bring that on home for a good time?

					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					<div class="borders">
					This is a guide for anyone interested in the field of robotics, specifically in the field of FBP and prosthetic repair and maintenance, or anyone who is looking to learn how to care for themselves or others.
					<br><br>
					In this guide will go through the basics of how to repair physical damage, electrical damage as well as more complex things such as repairing damage to the internal structure of the prosthetic, rewiring the inner workings of a prosthetic.
					<br><br>
					On top of all that we will also go over how to repair prosthetic hearts or eyes, as well as how to initiate a hard reset on an FBP's systems after a large amount of damage has been inflicted on the individual.
					</div>
					<h1>Tools</h1>
					<div class="borders">
					Before you start working on repairs, you should have the following parts on hand:<br>
					<ul>
					<li>Cyborg Scanner. </li>
					<li>Welder. </li>
					<li>Wire Cable </li>
					<li>Screwdriver </li>
					<li>Crowbar </li>
					<li>Wire cutters </li>
					<li>Multitool </li>

					<h1>Basic Repairs</h1>
					<div class="borders">
					When the damage is superficial, the following steps can be taken.
					<ul>
					<li>Scan the patient with your cyborg scanner.</li>
					<li>If the damage is physical in nature, weld the affected area free of dents. Don't forget your welding protection.</li>
					<li>If the damage appears electrical, search for burnt or damaged wires and replace them.</li>
					</ul>
					</div>
					<h1>Advanced Repairs</h1>
					<div class="borders">
					When the damage is severe and extends past the surface, the following steps can be taken.
					<ul>
					<li>Ensure the damage is internal. If an area registers as 30 or higher on your scanners, it is internal.</li>
					<li>Use a screwdriver to remove screws from the appropriate maintenance panel.
					Crowbar the panel open.</li>
					<li>Follow the basic steps appropriate to the damage: inner structures can be repaired through welding, while electrical damages can be rewired.</li>
					<li>Crowbar the panel closed to finish.</li>
					</ul>
					Additionally, more delicate parts of the FBP may be damaged. For things such as the microbatteries, eyes, and brain, the following steps may help you.
					<ul>
					<li>Open the appropriate segment: either the head or the torso.</li>
					<li>Using a screwdriver -- or preferably, nanopaste -- you may repair these parts.</li>
					<li>Remember to close the segment when you are finished.</li>
					</ul>

					</style>
					</head>
					<body>
					<h1>Jumper Cables</h1>
					<div class="borders">
					Should your patient be damaged to the point where their systems need to be jump started, you'll need your nearby jumper cables.
					<ul>
					<li>Repair the damages as explained above.</li>
					<li>Prepare your jumper cables. You should hold the device on your back and take the paddles into both hands.</li>
					<li>Place the paddles on their chest and give them a shock.</li>
					<li>Sometimes, damage to the brain does not register until a jump start. Always check after a failure and repair as necessary before trying again.</li>
					</ul>
					</div>
					<h1>Conclusion</h1>
					<div class="borders">
					And with that, you have all the essential steps to repairing and maintaining FBP's and prosthetics. These steps are applicable to any prosthetic limb, regardless of if the patient is an FBP. However, if an organic has a prosthetic organ and needs it repaired, it is best you refer them to medical and their team of highly trained surgeons to repair it.

				<center><sub>by Ray Rogers</sub></center><br>
				<div class="border">
				Each player starts with three attributes: <i>Vigor</i>, <i>Grit</i>, and <i>Giddyup</i>. Vigor counts how strong, how healthy, and how in-shape a cowpoke is. Grit defines how well a cowpoke can deal with wounds, how gritty his stare is, and how much ice cold water runs through their veins. Giddyup controls how agile a cowpoke is, how well they can dodge a bullet, and how well they can sling.<br><br>
				When rolling an attribute, a cowpoke uses one d6. If they roll a 4 or above, they succeed. A cowpoke can roll more or less d6s depending on situational advantages/disadvantages, items they may be carrying, or abilities they may have accrued in their time moseying. As long as a cowpoke has one more success than failure, they succeed. For each additional success, up to 6, that success is enhanced or modified in some way.<br><br>
				In combat, initiative is gained by pulling poker cards. Initiative is then resolved from highest to lowest suit and number. In the event of tying cards, suits are resolved in this order: Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, and then Clubs. Then the cowpoke who gets highest goes on his turn. During their turn, they can do anything they please. Whatever action they want to achieve, they describe it narratively, and then the storyteller tells them how many d6s they may roll to achieve this task.

				<h2>How to Survive a Mass Depressurization Event</h2>
				<div class="borders">
				<ul>
				<li><b>Don your internals.</b></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="indent">This is the first thing you should do in a mass depressurization event. Take out the breath mask and emergency air tank from the emergency box in your backpack. Put on the mask and clip the air tank securely to your belt; this way, you will not lose it if you fall over or pass out. Set the distribution pressure on your air tank to at least 18 kPA to conserve air. This represents the minimum threshold for a human to maintain consciousness.</p>
				<ul>
				<li><b>Find more oxygen.</b></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="indent">You may find that your air tank will soon run out. Do not worry. There are numerous emergency oxygen closets placed throughout the station, blue in color with 'O2' written on the front in white. You can also retrieve an oxygen tank from a fire closet. When possible, fill up your air tank in one of the large, blue O2 canisters by inserting your air tank, setting the distribution pressure to max, and turning on the release valve. Just make sure to turn the release valve off before removing your oxygen tank.</p>
				<ul>
				<li><b>Stay aware of your surroundings.</b></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="indent">Keep track of the local atmosphere. What is the pressure? Is it rising or falling? A pressure of 101 kPA is optimal for human survival, but you can survive conditions as low as 80 kPA for extended periods. You can check the pressure on the air alarms placed throughout the station or with your PDA's atmospheric scanner function. Make sure to check the pressure several times in quick succession, so you can know whether it is rising or falling.</p>
				<ul>
				<li><b>Avoid opening fire locks.</b></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="indent">In the event of depressurization, the station's fire locks automatically drop in an attempt to contain the breach. However, this can also impede movement. If possible, find an alternate route to your destination or find a safe place to wait until the station's engineering team repairs the station. Do not open a fire lock without an engineer's express permission unless you are in immediate mortal danger. After you have opened a fire lock, make sure to close it immediately so as to prevent the breach from spreading.</p>
				    <ul>
				<li><b>Listen to emergency personnel.</b></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="indent">Follow the instructions of engineering, medical, and security personnel, as well as the orders of the heads of staff. Engineering personnel are trained to fix these situations, and medical personnel will likely be conducting search and rescue operations. Do not impede them and follow their instructions; you are more likely to survive, and less likely to endanger your fellow crew members.</p>
