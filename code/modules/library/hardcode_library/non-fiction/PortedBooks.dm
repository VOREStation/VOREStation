				One may find the problems inherent in co-habitation well illustrated through the ubiquity of light bulbs among virtually all settlements. In colonies like the "} + span_italics("NCS Northern Star") + {", where I make my residence, the bulbs are uniform in design and output. But it is clear to see that various species require different amounts of light for proper vision -- we Teshari and our Tajaran comrades require less, while Dionaea require more. In addition, these light bulbs are low-heat, which the cold-blooded Unathi would certainly not prefer.
				<br><br>
				In short-- the standard light bulbs aboard even a cosmopolitan space station in the Vir Cluster are calibrated for the preferences and biology of humans and Skrell. It is obvious that we Teshari would benefit greatly from having structures tailored to our own culture and anatomy, from hallway redesign to the very filaments of the light-bulbs.

However, when stations get larger, and larger, and their populations soar to five and six digits, the situation becomes untenable.<br><br>
					Representative democracies have been the most stable form of government for a variety of reasons. Firstly, they are a system that is not subject to the whims of a single person, or even a few, but are controlled by the general population, which is not as likely to shift rapidly and disastrously, not to mention far less likely to cause strife for the people. The second and more critical reason is that people, especially educated people with access to proper communications, desire the ability to rule their own lives. They may surrender this for material goods, but once material needs are satisfied, they will seek out the ability to fulfill their own purposes.<br><br>
					Corporate government denies the ability to do this. It denies even the possibility, as why would a company give up a position that is giving them such amazing profits? The situation is untenable. Already we can see in some stations a small but growing element that is dissatisfied with the situation. Phrases like "tyranny" and "corporate dictatorship" are thrown around, and not without justification. If corporations do not act to give people control over the rule of their homes, things will go badly - for the companies.

					The Persian empire first started as a vassal to the Median empire. In the year 612 B.C., the Medes had conquered much land, including the Assyrian capital of Nineveh. The Median king, Astyges, decided that he would arrange his daughter, Mandane, to the Persian king, Cambyses I. At this time, the Persians were little more than a tribe. With this marriage, he secured an alliance with the Persian people, and they soon bore a son they named Cyrus.<br><br>
					Astyges had a dream, which his priests interpreted as a bad omen. They claimed that his grandson would one day overthrow him and grow an army to spread around the continent. To challenge this dream, he assigned his general, Harpagus, to kill his daughter's first child. He was ordered to take the infant and leave him to the mountainside to be eaten by the beasts, but he could not do that. Instead, he decided to give the child to an adoptive family.

					The young Cyrus was indeed an ambitious figure. As historical records show, the Median general Harpagus decided to betray the king and assisted Cyrus in speedily taking over the throne. By capturing the Median capital of Ecbtana, Cyrus became king of both the Persians and the Medes, uniting the people as one. The neighboring country of Lydia had threatened the Medes in the past, to which Cyrus used as a justification to invade and conquered them as well. Cyrus would then be known as Cyrus the Great, and would be praised by his people for his exploits. His actions earned him the admiration of his people and rivals alike.<br><br>
					Cyrus' most famous conquest would be historical Babylon. The Babylonian empire was built along the river of the Euphrates, and was regarded as a treasure of the world. Tempted by the prize, Cyrus set his course.<br><br>
					Babylon was surrounded by a massive wall, with some two-hundred manned arching posts alongside it. Attacking the city head on would surely result in failure. However, since the Euphrates river also flew directly inside parts of the city, Cyrus saw his chance. He instructed his men to dam the river, allowing his troops to advance through the lowered waters. A brief surprise attack followed, and Babylon was conquered.<br><br>
					What's significant about the fall of Babylon, was how the Babylonians actually praised Cyrus for it. Nabondius, the former king, was at odds with the priests. They had claimed that he had not been facilitating religious ceremonies properly, and was interfering for his own benefit. When Cyrus came to power, he immediately ordered a reconstruction of all damaged temples and allowed religious practices to be commenced of any kind; Even though the Persians followed the religion of Zoroastrianism, they never forced any of their subjects to worship the same. Because of this, Persia was one of the first lands of religious tolerance, and many different beliefs could be found. The Jews, who had been slaves to Babylon, were released and given safe passage back to Jerusalem. Cyrus had been established as perhaps the earliest believer of human rights in the world.

					By conquering Babylon, Cyrus had ultimately defeated the major threats to his empire, and expanded his borders to cover the Middle East, parts of Modern-day Turkey, Greece, Egypt, and Asia. Not only this, but his people were infatuated with him and how smoothly he ran his empire. Cyrus never ceased to expand his empire, until his death.<br><br>
					Nearing his sixties, Cyrus continued to lead his troops to conquer more land and wealth for his people. Traveling up north, he encountered a tribe of people known as the Massagetae. According to legend, the tribal queen, Tomyris, witnessed Cyrus kill her son in battle. Tomyris proceeded to decapitate Cyrus and douse his head in a bucket of his own blood. A beautiful painting by the 18th century French Renaissance painter Jean-Simon Berthelemy depicts this gruesome scene.

Darius wasted no time to carry on his grandfather's honor. He continued to expand the empire even further, all the way to the western hemisphere, right at the doorstep of the Greeks. Darius would be famous for his administrative prowess. He introduced the Satrap system to govern his lands. Since the territories were so vast, it was difficult for one man to effectively govern it all. Many rebellions would rise and would need to be quelled. Satraps were representatives of the king himself. They would serve as a governor of each Persian city-state. They would often enjoy the luxury of complete control of their lands if the king was away.

By 330 B.C., the Persian empire had collapsed into several sprawling states, never to fully see the glory of it's legacy again.<br><br>

					Many Humans and Tajaran consider the Skrellian Caste system to be a relatively egalitarian social model, as it is seemingly unaccompanied by the political and economic subjugation that follows historical human and Tajaran modes of oppression. This is the model of the Caste system presented by the wealthiest parts of Skrellian space, and to judge the Caste system by how it operates on Qerr'Balak would be akin to judging laissez-faire economics based on how it operates on Luna, or the Overseer political system based on how it operated for the Overseers. In order to understand the repercussions of a social system, one must understand how it operated for the most marginalized - the out-caste. <br><br>
					Skrellian education is viewed to be a life-long endeavor, and it is expected that a well-educated individual stay in formal schooling, known as Keri-Gloa, until the age of twenty-five. Keri-Gloa is not universal, however, but rather segregated into castes with education carefully selected to teach Skrell only what is befitting to someone of their social status. My own education as a member of the Kanin-Katish, for example, was heavy on education on architecture and engineering while the social sciences, arts, and research-based sciences were untouched. To drop out of this education leaves one a stigmatized Qrri-Mog, for which a very rough translation into Galactic Common would be a "lesser worker", but this does not fully encapsulate the stigma surrounding it. Qrri-Mog are viewed as unenlightened, stupid, and unworthy of job opportunities that involve any level of mental capacity, even if such a person has education from other sources. Thus, those unsatisfied with their caste's occupation is given two choices - conform, or face unemployment. Though there is no political mechanism to force conformity, there is an economic mechanism which enforces the status quo.

					</style>
					</head>
					<body>
					<div class="border">
					Qrri-Mog are also denied political opportunity to change the social structure from within. Most Skrellian city-states have a two-pronged political system, with a head of state known as the Qerr-Skria who has both executive and judiciary power, and a legislative body known as the Xaq Moglar. Both of these are highly exclusive. Let us begin with the Qerr-Skria, which is the clearest sign of caste inequality, as the Qerr-Skria is selected only from the Qerr-Katish caste, which translates roughly to "Highest Caste". A quick note on Skrellian linguistics is that the two most common prefixs are Qerr, which is high or good, and Qrii, which is low or bad. The Qerr-Katish represent a small minority of Skrell, receive the highest education available separate from other castes from the earliest levels, and are the only Skrell eligible for the position of Qerr-Skria. I hope that I do not need to explain to the reader the inequity of that. The nature of the position of Qerr-Skria, specifically their advisers, also structurally enforces caste conformity. The Qerr-Skria appoints a body of advisers known as the Qerr-Koal from the members of each caste considered to be the wisest, which directly correlates to those who best succeeded in their assigned educational path. Out-castes who pursue education outside of this path are illegible. This is true of the Xaq Moglar as well, which is composed entirely of academics, which is to say that Qrri-Mog, and thus out-castes as well, cannot be heard in legislature. With no internal voice in politics, out-castes have no choice but to either suffer in silence or make change from outside of the political system.<br><br>
					Thus, the Caste system perpetuates itself and its inequity. All Skrellian citizens are given a single choice and no other options - conform, or exist outside of all available power structures. By restricting power only to those who fit within the caste system, no internal change has been possible, and the only way that it can be changed is by creating forces outside of the existing power structure, be it revolution, protest, or garnering the support of outside governments.
