					Sasha set down his wrench with a sigh, wiping his toned forearm along his brow to clear the thin sheet of sweat that he'd built up, properly preparing the heating system. It had been a hard day of work for him so far, near alone on the cold plains of Sif. He, along with a scant few other men had been hired to help build a Tajaran lady a secretive cabin amongst the frosty tundra.<br><br>
					Katya was a shy young thing, barely breaking twenty-five and already wanting to hide from the world, but if Sasha had learned anything in the last few weeks, it was that her shyness had done nothing to dull how sweet she could be. Seeing he had finished a sizeable section of work, she emerged from the blizzard tent being used as temporary shelter with a steaming hot mug of coco in hand for both of them.<br><br>
					Handing over one of the little cups of warmth, she swayed her dark brown furred hips back and forth, watching Sasha take a cautious sip to test the temperature, leaving a thin milk moustache atop his stubbled lip. The little Tajaran smiled at him, and pulled a handkerchief from the waistband of her skirt to dab away at the mark.<br><br>
					"Carrreful~" she said, "You'll catch yourrr death of a cold out herrrre if you're not."<br><br>
					Sasha smiled back at her, one of his muscular hands going to ruffle at her hair.<br><br>
					"You're so kind, miss Katya" he replied, "I just wish there was something I could do to repay such gestures."<br><br>
					Katya gave a pleased little sigh at the gesture of affection, the warmth from the coco having seeped into Sasha's hand, and now flowing into her. She took him by the wrist with a cheeky smile, guiding his palm to her cheek instead. His touch was gentle as she redirected him, his tender grasp doing as much to warm her as the steaming milk in her hand.<br><br>
					"It gets cold and lonely out herrre all alone. If you rrreally wish to do something morrre forrr herrrr, perrrhaps we can spend some time by the firrre tonight, togetherrrr. Beforrre you go to bed."<br><br>

					How could Sasha refuse such a request? He gave a bassy chuckle, leaning forward to set an affectionate kiss on the Tajaran's forehead before letting her cheek free.<br><br>
					"Of course, miss Katya" he answered, "I've already split the logs from the tree I felled earlier, why don't you set up the fire and I'll finish weather proofing what I've done for the evening? It should be getting dark soon after all."<br><br>
					She nodded cheerfuly and wandered off to the firepit by the tents, her tail flicking happily at the prospect of her evening's plans while Sasha lingered with his coco, appreciating every chocolatey second of the kind gesture from his employer. In near no time at all, there was a roaring fire burning at the construction site, providing nearly all the light for the evening as the sun dipped low beyond the horizon. Sasha, having finished his promised work, made his way over to join Katya.<br><br>
					Sasha set himself down by the fire and leaned back against his palms spread out behind him, stretching out his weary, muscular back with a growl of satisfaction before twisting slightly to watch the Tajaran prepare for the evening proper. In one hand she carried the ingredients for s'mores, while under that same arm she lugged over a pair of weighty woolen blankets. In her other's grasp, she once again held two steaming mugs, this time filled with decaff tea to settle them in for the night.<br><br>
					Katya wasted no time in getting herself close to Sasha, sitting in his lap while setting the mugs aside before spreading the blanket over them. Her tail curled up behind her, the tip wrapping its way around the back of Sasha's neck like a warm, furry scarf, sheltering the sensitive skin from the cold as he was sheltering the rest of her. He wrapped his strong arms around her, taking a moment to rest his nose and chin in her clean, but windswept hair, catching the scent of honey and vanilla from her shampoo.<br><br>

					There they sat for hours, first in silence as they simply appreciated each other's presence, then amidst a flurry of discussion. He asked of the woman she was, how she grew to be so reserved, why she was so sweet to those around her, what she did to whittle away the hours when she was alone with nothing but her thoughts. She asked of the man he wanted to be, where he wanted to be in the future, who the sort of person was that he envisioned himself being with, and when he wanted to settle down in the future.<br><br>
					As the fires of their interest in each other grew, the fire warming the pair slowly petered out into nothingness, neither willing to get up to feed the flames of anything but their desires. Sasha had barely even been willing to relent his graps around Katya's waist, not that she had complained. She had acted the hands for both of them most of the evening, toasting s'mores and leaning back into his toned chest to reach up and pop the marshmellowy goodness into his mouth, usually accompanied by a giggle sweeter than the treat she'd just offered. Sasha had not even touched his tea, all thirst but one sated already.<br><br>
					Katya had not anticipated this, however, and as the embers finally died into nothing and she begrudgingly relinquished the intimacy, she was caught off guard while whisking the now chilled mug up to clean it out. The tea spilled everywhere, most of the cool liquid soaking Sasha's work clothing, drawing a gasp of surprise from both of them.<br><br>
					"She is so sorrrrry!" Katya exclaimed, hand covering her mouth in a mixture of shock and embaressment, "It was a complete accident!"<br><br>
					Though Sasha did not seem remotely angry at the mistake, he was quickly losing body heat in his now soaked clothing, especially now that there was no fire to warm them.<br><br>
					His teeth chattered as he replied, "I'm n-n-n-not m-m-m-mad" he replied calmly, "b-b-b-ut that was my only p-p-p-pair of d-d-d-dry clothes!"<br><br>
					The Tajaran, experienced with many nights in the cold, sprung into action. "You must get out of yourrrr clothes beforrre you frrrreeze!" she said, panicing.<br><br>
					"B-b-but I only h-h-have a s-s-sleeping bag!" he replied, slightly fearful.<br><br>
					The Tajaran quickly helped him from his wet clothing, unperturbed by his worries.<br><br>
					"You can stay in herrrr tent tonight! We will sharrre body heat, and keep you safe!"<br><br>
					Now free from his chilling clothing, she quickly ushered him inside her temporary abode, and bundled under the covers with him.<br><br>

					The pair of them collapsed breathlessly against each other, each basking in the afterglow of the evening. He gave a quiet, pleased growl, and she a soft purr of satisfaction while cuddling up against Sasha's heaving, sweaty pecs.<br><br>
					"I hope--" he said, between growls and breaths, "I hope that you had a nice night, miss Katya..."<br><br>
					Having gotten her breath back first, she gave a light nod and tilted her head back, pressing a line of affectionate kisses from chin, to temple, her teeth sinking lightly into her earlobe while she gave her reply, ASMR sending a shiver down his spine from her whispered reply.<br><br>
					"It. Was. Purrrrfect..."<br><br>
					Outside the wind howled, and the shantaks called to each other in the darkness, but Katya and Sasha blocked it all from their minds as they drifted off to sleep, safe and comfortable in each other's arms.<br><br>
