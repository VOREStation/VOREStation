					Once upon a time there was a cat, but he wasnít the kind of cat youíre thinking of. He was from the land of the fairies and his fur was completely unexpected colors. For starters, his nose was <i>violet</i>. His eyes were <i>indigo</i>, his ears were <i>sky blue</i>, his front paws were <i>green</i>, his body was <i>yellow</i>, his back paws were <i>orange</i>, and his tail was <i>red</i>. So he was a mysterious cat of seven colors arranged just like a rainbow.
					<br><br>
					That rainbow cat went on all sorts of strange adventures. The following story is one of them.
					<br><br>
					One day while the rainbow cat was sunbathing, he was suddenly vexed by boredom. That is to say, peace reigned in the land of the fairies, so nothing much was going on.
					<br><br>
					<i>Itís not good for my health to spend all my time idling about as if I havenít got a care in the world,</i> he thought. <i>Perhaps I should head out and go on an adventure.</i>
					<br><br>
					So he put a note up on his door: "Dear Mr. Post Man, I will be gone for two or three days, so if any packages or letters come, please throw them down the chimney."
					<br><br>
					Then he packed a small bag, hung it on his tail, and wobbled off to the border of the land of the fairies. When he arrived, a thick cloud billowed up.
					<br><br>
					"Well, maybe Iíll drop by the cloud peopleís place," he chattered to himself, climbing up the cloud embankment.
					<br><br>
					The people who lived in cloud country were quite pleasant folks. They didnít do any work, in particular, but just because they were lazy didnít mean that they didnít find the world interesting. They all lived in splendid palaces, of which the ones you couldnít see from Earth were far more beautiful than the ones you could.
					<br><br>
					The people of the cloud country sometimes drove pearly gray carriages or went sailing in lightweight boats. They lived in the sky, so the only person they had to fear was Sir Thunder. Itís quite understandable given that he was quick to anger -- he would make the sky rumble with his stomping and go around knocking down their houses.
					<br><br>
					The people of the cloud country were very happy to have the rainbow cat visit and greeted him politely.
					<br><br>
					"Youíve come at a great time," they said. "Weíre having a big celebration at the Wind Godís house. His eldest son, North Wind is taking the daughter of the King of the Magic Isle as his wife."
					<br><br>
					The rainbow cat, having thought just such a thing might happen, was prepared with various goods in the bag on his tail.
					<br><br>
					It was a truly magnificent wedding.
					<br><br>
					Everyone came. Even Comet showed up. You wouldnít see Comet unless it was a very fine banquet indeed.
					<br><br>
					And Aurora came in the most indescribably beautiful garments of light. Of course, the brideís parents, the King of Magic Isle and his Pearl Oyster Queen, were in attendance.
					<br><br>
					A feast was served and everyone was in a lively mood, having interesting conversations and drinking, when all of the sudden a swallow flew in. According to him, the giant Sir Thunder was rushing towards them at a tremendous speed. Apparently, when Trade Wind was hurrying by, he had tripped over sleeping Sir Thunderís toes and Sir Thunder was furious.
					<br><br>
					"Whatíll we do?" everyone wondered at once, their faces pale. "The celebration will be ruined!"
					<br><br>
					All the guests and the master of the house began to scatter in a panic.
					<br><br>
					However, the rainbow cat remained calm. He had quite a bit of sense.
					<br><br>
					The cat crept under the table, opened the small bag he had brought, and gave everything inside renewed consideration.
					<br><br>
					A moment later, he came back out.
					<br><br>
					"Iíll find a way to keep Sir Thunder from coming here," said the cat. "So please continue the celebration as you were. Iíll go to him and see what I can do."
					<br><br>
					Everyone was surprised at how brave and composed the rainbow cat was, but it sounded like their celebration wouldnít be intruded upon partway through, so they were happy to gather and see off the cat as he raced towards the far-off rumblings of Sir Thunder.

					The rainbow cat ran until he caught sight of the giant off in the distance. Then he stopped, opened his bag, and took out a big mantle. He put it on with the hood snuggly over his ears, sat down, and pretended to be deep in thought about something or other.
					<br><br>
					Sir Thunder came upon this mysterious-looking figure in the middle of the celestial road and stopped.
					<br><br>
					"Hey, who are you and what are you doing here?" he shouted.
					<br><br>
					"Me? Iím the famed magician Mewpuu," replied the rainbow cat in a voice made to sound serious and important. "Take a look at my bag, here. There are magic seeds inside. Mr. Thunder, Iíve known about you for a while now. Youíre quite famous."
					<br><br>
					Hearing this Sir Thunder felt a bit proud, but his foot was sore, so he was soon angry again.
					<br><br>
					"Hrmph! I donít think too highly of magicians. What can you do, anyways?"
					<br><br>
					"I can read your mind."
					<br><br>
					"Oh? Is that so? Then try to guess what Iím thinking right now."
					<br><br>
					"A simple matter. Youíre angry because your foot hurts and you want to catch the fellow who kicked your blister, right?"
					<br><br>
					The rainbow cat had heard all that from the swallow. Sir Thunder was flabbergasted.
					<br><br>
					"Wow, thatís right. Will you teach me your magic?"
					<br><br>
					"Sure I will. But first I must test your potential. Have a seat."
					<br><br>
					Sir Thunder sat down. The rainbow cat walked in a circle around him three times mumbling gibberish under his breath.
					<br><br>
					"Now then, try to tell me what I am thinking right now," said the cat.
					<br><br>
					Sir Thunder the giant looked blankly at the catís face. He was not very bright.
					<br><br>
					"You must be thinking that I look pretty foolish sitting here."
					<br><br>
					"Excellent. Astonishing! You have more than enough talent to begin the training. You may be my brightest disciple yet."
					<br><br>
					"Then maybe Iíll try one more time." Sir Thunder now thought himself terribly sharp.
					<br><br>
					"Very well. Try to guess what Iím thinking."
					<br><br>
					Sir Thunder tried to look wise and peered at the catís face with his small, goofy eyes.
					<br><br>
					"Beef steak and onions," he announced abruptly.
					<br><br>
					"Brilliant!" the cat feigned surprise and purposely lost his footing to land on his rump. "Youíre exactly right. But how did you know?"
					<br><br>
					"Oh, how do you say...? I guess it just came to me," replied Sir Thunder.
					<br><br>
					The cat assumed a serious air. "We must cultivate that fine talent of yours!"
					<br><br>
					"How do we cultivate it?" asked Sir Thunder. He thought being able to read peopleís minds was quite fun.
					<br><br>
					"Itís a cinch," said the cat, finally telling a blatant lie now that he thought he had the giant where he wanted him. "Go home and sleep for two or three hours. Then have some cake and sleep another two or three hours. Then, when you wake up, drink one cup of hot tea. But you have to be as still as possible or it wonít work. If you do all that, by tomorrow morning youíll be reading peopleís minds like itís nothing."
					<br><br>
					Sir Thunder wanted to go running straight home, but of course, he couldnít forget his manners. "Thanks a lot. But Master Mewpuu, what can I offer you in return for teaching me this?"
					<br><br>
					The rainbow cat thought a moment and said, "Iíd like a tiny bit of lightning. Please give me just a smidge."
					<br><br>
					Sir Thunder the giant put his hand in his pocket and said, "No problem. If thatís all, I have a bundle of it right here, so please take this. When you need it, just undo the string and the lightning will come out in a most amusing way."
					<br><br>
					"Thank you very much."
					<br><br>
					Then the cat accepted the bundle of lightning and the two of them courteously shook hands.
					<br><br>
					Sir Thunder the giant hurried home and did as he was told. Thereafter, he believed that he could guess whatever anyone was thinking. As such, he was quite content, and never caused any more harm.
					<br><br>
					The rainbow cat took his bundle of lightning and returned to the castle straight away. Everyone was grateful for all he had done for them and thanked him unanimously. The rainbow cat, immensely satisfied, remained at the cloud palace for one week before returning home to the land of the fairies.
					<br><br>
					What happened after that... is another story.

					The door gave under Sergei's gloved fist and crashed silently to the floor, twisted around its remaining plastic hinge.<br><br>
					"Whoops," Sergei's voice mumbled through the earpiece. Michael didn't need to look at the his partner to know that beneath his helmet, the Texan was cringing.<br><br>
					"S'all right." A pristine environment would make their job easier, but salvaging didn't require perfection. Michael softly shouldered past the younger man and moved into the abandoned living quarters, careful not to snag his suit. Other than the ruined door, the room was in mint condition. Depressurization had clearly been a gentle process here; air slowly leaking through seals that had been designed for hours of vacuum exposure, not years. The left side of the room was taken up by a desk, with a bunk bed situated at a comfortable height above. On the right was what appeared to a be a closet set into the wall, as well as a recessed table with some kind of lab equipment on it which Michael's salvaging experience immediately filed away as <i>valuable</i>. <br><br>
					The cabin's walls, floors, furniture, and even bed sheets were an almost uniform gray. Any discernible difference in shade was whitewashed out by the harsh light emanating from a large rounded rectangle in the wall opposite to the door. Michael stared at the rectangle, not sure he believed what he was seeing. Behind him, Sergei swore softly.<br><br>
					"That's a real window." He murmured. "Like, not a screen. I've never seen one of those on a starship before."<br><br>
					"Me neither." Michael wondered what it was made of. Even from the doorway he could see that the material had to be more than half a meter thick, completely penetrating the inner and outer hull of the ship. Suddenly anxious, he checked his Geiger; the rad count was unchanged. He grunted in surprise. "Well, it's shielded, whatever it is. Let's get what we came for."

					You can see lights shining far out at sea. In an area like this one, right around the arctic, the blue-black water of the ocean is immense and it's always cold. Once a shining light in the distance was coming closer and closer to the shore. The closer it came, the more clearly it could be seen. It was an iceberg. The iceberg was big, pointed upwards like a mountain and reflected a piercing light, and also had an area flat and wide enough to carry a large number of people. And of course there is no way of telling how far down the iceberg continued below the surface of the water. All icebergs are formed from crystal-like ice and drift with the currents of the sea. It seemed as if a new iceberg came into sight almost every day. Once there was a huge, slow-moving hunk of ice flowing aimlessly, and even from far off, we were afforded a view of its glittering peak. The lonesome setting sun broke through the clouds and the light which shone from the iceberg reflected in the eyes of those who stood on the shore, all gazing upon the mountain of ice as it moved further and further away. Another time an iceberg came towards us with frightening speed, like a frozen steam ship. Up upon this white, shining piece of ice was not a shadow of a living thing to be seen.<br><br>
					Once an iceberg came in close to the shore and everyone saw a small black silhouette fall into the ocean.<br><br>
					"Some kind of black bird, maybe?"<br><br>
					"A bird? More like a sea lion or a seal."<br><br>
					So said the people standing on the shore looking out over the sea. However, when it came in even closer, they could see that it was a bear. It was angry and trying its hardest to get to the shore. Most likely the bear had ventured out onto the ice to play, but while the bear was playing the sheet of ice would have become separated and the bear would have found itself lost at sea. Everyone knew nothing good would come from that bear making it onto land. It would probably lash out.<br><br>
					"Alright, everyone, just keep your guard up. If that bear makes it to the shore there is no telling what might happen," was what the people had said. And so the people brought with them rifles and spears. But the iceberg never came close enough to the shore, and eventually it floated back out to sea. Everyone was relieved that the bear never made it ashore, but it was actually a little depressing to think about where that bear would have ended up.<br><br>
					These are the kinds of things that happen in the north. And that is the kind of story I'll tell you today.

					"There haven't been any icebergs lately and the sea is so calm. Why don't we go on a fishing trip?" said one of three fishermen one day. So they boarded their boat and headed out to sea. The three fishermen eventually came close to an island. No one lived on the island and it had a little inlet where there was often some good fishing to be had. So they decided to stop and try to catch some fish, all the while mindful of the time. When they did catch fish, they normally caught a surprising amount. Just when the three fishermen were wondering if they should move on to the next fishing spot, they could see signs that today's catch would be a good one.<br><br>
					"Looks like we're in luck"<br><br>
					"Luck indeed!"<br><br>
					The three fishermen were in high spirits. They dropped their net into the water and when they pulled it back up, they found themselves with a bigger catch of fish than ever before. It was such a big catch, in fact, that they left the fish on the shore of the island to pick up on the way home, as too much fish in the boat would only slow them down.<br><br>
					One of the three fishermen remained on the island. In the evening he would light a fire to let the other two know where he was as they sailed home. So the first fisherman stood on the shore and watched as the second and third fisherman pushed off from the island and into the sea with a heave and a ho.
					"Hurry back, alright?!" the first fisherman called out to his two friends.<br><br>
					"Miss us already? Don't worry, we'll drag ourselves back your way," the pair called back with a chuckle as they floated further and further away. A quiet evening began to set in as the first fisherman watched the boat drift out to sea until it disappeared into the blue-black of the ocean. When he was a child he thought the surface of the ocean looked flat as a straw mat, but the rippling, violent sea was nothing like that now. The wind picked up as the sun went down. It was sudden and unexpected. Soon the waves grew high and howling. The first fisherman began to worry about his two friends who were still out at sea.<br><br>
					"Bring my friends back in one piece, as quickly as you can," he prayed as he set about starting a bonfire to guide his friends through the dark of the night. The weather turned to wind and rain. The fire that the first fisherman had started was eventually blown out. So the first fishermen set about feverishly starting another fire. But the boat he was waiting to arrive never did.

					"I wonder where they might be taking shelter from the storm. There is no where else to go in this wide, wide ocean. They must have sunk...îù<br><br>
					The first fisherman had started to worry as the stormy night turned to complete darkness. Whenever he looked out, the waves of the ocean were winding into the skies above. He could see no sign of a boat. The first fisherman had been abandoned on the small, deserted island. He stood on the rocks of the shore and waited a full day for his friends to return. But perhaps because the winds from yesterday had made the ocean rough, the sun that day went down without any sign of the boat he had been waiting for.<br><br>
					Three days passed. The first fisherman had started to grow weak. Finally, after standing on the beach looking intently out over the ocean for three days, the boat carrying his friends cut through the waves and sailed towards the beach. It felt like a thousand years since he had seen them last. He could see that the second fisherman and the third fisherman were fine and moving about on the boat.<br><br>
					"Hey!" the first fisherman called out over the water, raising both of his hands high in the air. When he did, it looked like they too had thrown their hands in the air and called back. Only he couldn't hear their voices. Just then as the setting sun illuminated the tips of the waves, the two fishermen on the boat came into sight, red in the face.<br><br>
					"Ahh, here's a sight for sore eyes, my two friends! They made it back alive," said the first fisherman, warm tears of joy swelling in his eyes. Before long the boat was nearly on the sand.<br><br>
					"Hey!" the first fisherman called out, his hand in the air. He thought the other to fishermen would respond, but just as the pair were about to turn to the side and bring their boat in, they disappeared like a puff of smoke. The first fisherman was shocked.<br><br>
					"A ghost ship!î

					The first fisherman lost all hope, threw himself down on the sand and began to cry. His imagination was running wild, and his nightmares ran through the night. When he awoke the next morning his eyes were blood-shot and his heart was pounding. It was just past midday. The first fisherman raised his head and looked out over the sea only to spot the same boat in the distance. But it was the same as yesterday, a ghost ship, that had come to the island. For a moment he was relieved, and happiness danced in his chest, but in the next instant his body shook with fear.<br><br>
					"Damn it. Are they trying to kill me?î said the first fisherman, as he started to lose his mind. The boat cut through the waves and came in closer and closer to the island. The first fisherman pulled out his pistol, aimed at the boat and pulled the trigger. But this time the boat wasn't a ghost, and it didn't disappear. Once the boat was docked at the beach, the two other fishermen scrambled up onto land.<br><br>
					"Have you gone completely mad?îù yelled one, which was enough to snap the first fisherman back to reality.<br><br>
					The first fisherman had gone completely mad. That night the winds had caused the boat to be pushed back against a nearby island. Once the waves had died down, the two fishermen went back to the island to rescue their friend. The two fishermen got their crazy friend back on the boat and returned to the mainland. The pair cared for their weakened friend, and through their care he was able to lose his madness and returned to how he used to be. And from there the three friends went on to be even better friends for a very long time. This story is still told in the harbors to the north where the head of that deserted island still pokes up from between those blue black waves.

					My mother told me once of when<br>
					A young hare ventured from her den<br>
					And as she danced in field and glen<br>
					The world sang joy about her.<br>
					But wicked hateful things abound<br>
					And that young hare these evils found<br>
					Then whisked her up from off the ground<br>
					And glen was left without her.<br><br>
					The wicked power tore asunder<br>
					And with this cruel and fateful blunder<br>
					Cast her to a world of wonder<br>
					Would she e'er see home again?<br>
					And so hare flew that mournful day<br>
					Over the sky and far away<br>
					And down and down, beneath the sea<br>
					To a place unlike the glen.<br><br>
					A world of men and man's design<br>
					A place where God's light would not shine<br>
					A Hell of steel beneath the brine<br>
					Where misery's echoes boomed.<br>
					And all around her there were others<br>
					Beasts like her, all sisters, brothers,<br>
					Locked up, all, with one another,<br>
					In deep sea-dark, entombed.<br><br>
					And in this crypt far from the shore<br>
					The hare lay down upon the floor<br>
					Imprisoned there forever more<br>
					And left to all her sorrow.<br>
					Her tender world was lost and gone<br>
					So joy and happiness foregone<br>
					She slept and cried and prayed for dawn<br>
					To wait the coming morrow.<br><br>
					The hound was still, the birds said naught,<br>
					The fox denied he had been caught,<br>
					The bear cried "<i>This is just our lot</i>",<br>
					And surrendered to his pain.<br>
					But the cat stood up and shook his head<br>
					And rising from his metal bed<br>
					He said: "<i>For now, I am not dead,<br>
					And I will not die in vain!</i>"<br><br>
					He cried aloud with much disdain<br>
					And tore about his stark domain<br>
					And said "<i>These walls cannot contain<br>
					A force as strong as I!</i>"<br>
					And the fox just laughed, and the birds all cried<br>
					And the bear knotted up himself and died<br>
					But the hare looked on as the poor cat tried<br>
					To break him free and fly.<br><br>
					He shook his chain with all his rage<br>
					And flew in anger 'round his cage<br>
					Decrying this dark mournful stage<br>
					And the hare stood up as well.<br>
					With passion did she then respond,<br>
					She chewed her ropes and broke her bonds,<br>
					And freed the cat, they ran beyond,<br>
					The ran to flee that Hell.<br><br>
					And what became of cat and hare?<br>
					Did they break free to purer air?<br>
					To guess their fate we shouldn't dare<br>
					Perhaps their tale closed well.<br>
					But for all the beasts trapped in the Nether<br>
					All life from out of loch and heather<br>
					The flock that could not work together<br>
					Are sure still trapped in Hell.<br><br>
					Incense sweet, and cradled warm<br>
					Like lovers coddled, arm in arm<br>
					Two souls, nomadic, fleeing harm:<br>
					That wicked, metal glen.<br>
					Now coming morn drives off the curse<br>
					Too startled still to dare converse<br>
					Both praying they have seen the worst<br>
					So ends their tale --

					I quickly began to digest this information.<br><br>
					Cube 15... Dead Zone Research and Tourism Department? ... Charles... is Unscannable?<br><br>
					What does that even mean? How can someone's mind be completely unscannable? That would mean what... That he has no readable brain-wave?!<br><br>
					I've never met my employees face to face, and I simply assumed that he was simply a bothersome fellow on disability status that kept filing complaints and then got transferred to DZRT.<br><br>
					I assumed he perished with the others when the Dead Zone "Godcatchers" experiment went horribly wrong.<br><br>
					When Captain introduced me to him, I was shocked, but my current shock doesn't even compare to this.<br><br>
					I didn't realize he was "unscannable", such is simply improbable!<br><br>
					I mean come on! I saw him eating beans this morning!. He's not brain-dead!<br><br>
					Is he?!<br><br>
					There were those who could not use the Neural Interface, but fully Unscannable? What the hell?!<br><br>
					I have to calm myself. Unscannability is impossible. The Grid must be broken.<br><br>
					It is giving me illogical answers.<br><br>
					Oh.. and... Minus infinity credits? How is that even mathematically possible? I've heard of bad credit scores, but this is ridiculous!<br><br>
					This scan and information is simply full of errors. That's it. Stupid errors. Ha ha Har.<br><br>
					As I speculated wildly, the neural signal had decided to respond to my rabidly circular thought patterns:<br><br>

					There was much more informative gibberish to read in my right eye about Charles Snippy, but Snippy suddenly smacked me right in the head, breaking my concentration.<br><br>
					Ouch!<br><br>
					He told me to go downstairs (obviously) and when I begged him to join me, he simply forcibly shoved me down the stairs and ran off into the smoke.<br><br>
					Argh!<br><br>
					I descended into the building's basement, tripping on rubbish and quickly left the burning skyscraper, avoiding the Zombie-bots by constantly looking at the neural signal bars.<br><br>
					If I had more time I'd put together a program that would track their movements in a 3D space, but alas, I was far too busy escaping and gasping for air.

				So, one day, outside 'is smithin' hut, a man came ter 'im. E' wos a big man, wif a big crown atop 'is head. One of tha' kingly sorts, tha' smith figured, so e' decided not ter stab 'im an' instead asked 'im wot e' wanted.<br><br>
				Tha' big man replied that e' wanted a sword. Not jus' any sword tha' any arseclown could make, but one o' tha' blacksmith's. 'Ad ter be perfect, wif' engravin's o' tha' king's deeds an' such.<br><br>
				Tha' smith nodded politely, wonderin' 'ow tha' hell e' wos s'posed ter know anythin' about this sod.<br><br>
				Tha' sod soon left on 'is white steed, an' the smith began 'is finest labor yet.<br><br>
				After many moons, tha' smith finally finished tha' sword. A thing o' beauty it wos, majestic in its sheen an' ever keen o' blade. Balance coulda used some work, but ye do wot ye can.<br><br>
				Tha' sod came back on 'is white horse an' demanded tha' sword. Tha' smith decided tha' e' wos done playin' second fiddle ter kingly types an' stabbed 'is horse, then stabbed tha' sod an' then stabbed tha' sod's wife, child, butler, goat, other horse, wagon, an' castle, in tha' precise order.<br><br>
