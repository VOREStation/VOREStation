// this is cursed but necessary or else vending product icons can be missing

// that they exist, and therefore can't generate the entries in the spritesheet for them
// and since assets are unique and can't be reloaded later, we have to make sure that GLOB.vending_products
// is populated with every single type of vending machine
// As this is only done at runtime, we have to create all the vending machines in existence and force them
// to register their products when this asset initializes.
