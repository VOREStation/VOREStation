	name = "Humans vs Positronics vs Drones"
	data = "Most brands are clearly associated with either humans (amputees or voluntary cyber-augmentation patients) or positronics. Despite the fact that MMI and posibrain interfaces are quite similar, and most brands are equally comfortable for both species, this stratification persists. The main reason for this is that human-seeming prosthetics are usually regarded as important for human mental well-being. Medical insurance often pays out more for humans than for positronics in the event of an accident, and humans are often more willing to pay higher prices for humanoid prosthetics. Some positronics regard this as discriminatory, and most believe that maintaining a divide between the two species does not help with social integration.\
	<br><br>\
	Drones completely eschew this divide-- their chassis are based on what is the most profitable for the group that maintains them. Usually, this means some sort of non-anthropomorphic lawbound chassis. When a humanoid body is required, it's usually the cheapest one available that meets the minimum requirements for the drone to do its job."

/datum/lore/codex/page/posiage
	name = "Positronics and Age"
	data = "Young positronics are unlikely to have much in the way of expensive belongings, including prosthetics. Most positronics come into the working world outside of a well-defined familial structure and are still paying off the debt from their first body.\
	Even those who do come into a family mature very quickly, not providing time for relatives to save up for an expensive chassis before they begin adulthood and working life. Because of these logistical concerns, even a positronic who has been in a well-paying job for a few years is unable to afford a high-quality chassis.\
	<br><br>\
	Most positronics buy their second chassis at around 10 to 15 years of age, and it is at these age that positronics in more middling chassis come into being. Positronics who want a high-end body must save for decades while scrambling for advancement in a galaxy that is rather bigoted more often than not."

/datum/lore/codex/page/variants
	name = "Variants"
	data = "Most prosthetic manufacturers produce more than one design, though they usually share significant design elements and exist in the same price-point. Monitor heads remain noticeably cheaper than proper heads, so those interested in penny-pinching will usually opt for a variant with a screen instead of a face."

/datum/lore/codex/page/kitbashing
	name = "Kitbashing"
	data = "Different corporations' prosthetics are not designed to be slotted together.\
	There are exceptions: most industrial brands utilize a shared standard set of connectors, and of course there are Unbranded models that play well with any and all parts.\
	Nonetheless, attempting to splice together parts across these lines runs into a variety of technical problems. Most common are sensory and motor cross-wirings, leading to synthesia, uncontrollable jitters, and occasional paralysis. These are uncomfortable enough that most amateur bodymodders give up after one too many hallucinations. Certain combinations of parts run into structural issues-- putting a Hephestus torso on a pair of Morpheus legs is likely to deform those legs badly. Any cross-design kitbashing is likely to result in some level of structural instabilty and poor balance without hard work being put into the design.\
	<br><br>\
	Most of these can be addressed by a talented roboticist, but nonetheless most people tend to stick to a single brand of prosthetics. People who see their body's makeup as a means of self-expression, or as a machine to be optimized, are much more likely to take risks in pursuit of these goals."
