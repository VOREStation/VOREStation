/datum/lore/codex/page/robo_unbranded
	name = "\"Unbranded\""
	data = "Based on hundreds of years of open-source development, \"Unbranded\" prosthetics are a low-price powered prosthesis option available throughout human space, even in the most desolate or newly settled systems. Occasionally, a popular unbranded design will be taken down due to claims of copyright infringement, but a new one invariably springs back up within a few months. Because Unbranded designs have a very loosely structured development process, bugs inevitably crop up, leading to a reputation for unreliability.\
	<br><br>\
	Unbranded prosthetics are extremely inexpensive but are sought out by those seriously dedicated to the Unbranded ethos. Due to their open-sourced nature, Unbranded prosthetics run the gamut of quality and style, though it's safe to assume that they're relatively poorly made. The ones that last longest on the Exonet tend to be glitchy; those that function are often removed on claims of copyright infringement."

/datum/lore/codex/page/robo_cyber
	name = "Cyber Solutions"
	data = "Morpheus Cyberkinetics makes the cheapest functioning prosthetics on the market. Cyber Solutions makes the cheapest prosthetics, period. Notoriously buggy and poorly-constructed, Cyber Solutions has been the target of a number of class action lawsuits by positronics whose bodies had literally fallen apart on them. While their quality has improved slightly since their most recent lawsuit, Cyber Solutions parts remain so low-quality that the company refuses to use them for their own low-price drone lines. Some tinkerers have managed to improve the parts far beyond the factory quality, and in some Mercurial subgroups Cyber Solutions modding is considered an art form.\
	<br><br>\
	Cyber Solutions prosthetics are only recommended for the truly destitute and dedicated tinkers."

/datum/lore/codex/page/robo_nt
	name = "NanoTrasen"
	data = "A fairly unremarkable prosthetic design, NanoTrasen health plans provide these as part of their famous corporate medical insurance. These are also provided to NanoTrasen-produced positronics at the end of their indenture and are considered fairly high quality for entry-level prosthesis. Outside of NanoTrasen facilities, NanoTrasen-brand prosthetics are fairly rare and not often sought out-- NanoTrasen's grey-black prosthetics are a visual sign of association with the company itself.\
	<br><br>\
	NanoTrasen prosthetics are a solid choice for any NanoTrasen employee. They're easy to come across in the event of a workplace accident and comfortable enough that many never feel the need to upgrade."

/datum/lore/codex/page/robo_wt
	name = "Ward-Takahashi GMB"
	data = "The manufacturing giant's prosthetic line is functionally quite similar to Nanotrasen, but is directed at the consumer market and cheaper than Nanotrasen's own product. Aesthetically, of course, they are worlds apart, trading Nanotrasen's black gunmetal for rounded white plastic. The design endeavors to avoid the \"uncanny valley\" that plagues humaniform robot designs, by abstracting away the human shape into a series of connected ovals. Artists debate whether or not it succeeds, while normal people are more concerned with WT's tendency to accrue dirt and scratches with hard use.\
	<br><br>\
	Ward-Takahashi is popular through all economic classes, from poor to wealthy. Though it takes more wear-and-tear from heavy labor than dedicated industrial chassis, some use it for these tasks regardless."

/datum/lore/codex/page/robo_heph
	name = "Hephaestus Industries"
	data = "Hephaestus joined the civilian prosthetic market in earnest after the Hegemony War. Wartime amputees and fully-prosthetic Mechanized Division veterans found themselves looking for the Hephaestus parts that they had access to during the conflict. Hephaestus responded by producing the first civilian model of their rugged green prosthetics, leveraging their ties with SolGov to offer discounts to many of those returning from war. HI-Civilian is not quite as durable or easily maintained as the military model, to conform with most systems' legal restrictions on the capacities of prosthetic limbs, but maintains an unmatched reputation for resilience to damage and ease of repair.\
	<br><br>\
	Hephaestus prosthetics are somewhat expensive, but are a reasonable investment for many of average or above economic status. It has sufficient manual dexterity for most tasks, without sacrificing the rugged durability that made the brand popular."

/datum/lore/codex/page/robo_xion
	name = "Xion Manufacturing Group"
	data = "Xion's prosthetic designs are normally seen fairly rarely outside of Xion's extensive mining facilities, but have managed to proliferate because of the sheer number of positronics it creates and employs. Xion's limbs are cheap and rugged, but come with a number of drawbacks. Even positronic users complain about Xion's lack of sensitivity, but more problematic still is Xion's habit of leasing out their prosthetics as they do the rest of their equipment. Most people find the idea of not owning their own body extremely distressing, and because of this (and because Xion spearheads most anti-Unbranded lawsuits) Xion and Xion-like prosthetic designs are frequently available on pirate sites.\
	<br><br>\
	Xion prosthetics are most appropriate for the poor and underpaid. More wealthy people, and those whose jobs require precision works, are encouraged to pick a more open brand."

/datum/lore/codex/page/robo_grayson
	name = "Grayson Manufacturing"
	data = "Grayson is a new entrant into the prosthetics market. Their debut line is a rugged design built using polymers and alloys originally developed for Wulf Aeronautics, giving their parts a reputation for extremely solid construction. Unfortunately, the use of high-density materials in the construction process gives them an uncomfortable weight, something that Grayson has promised to correct in their next release. The parts are fairly cheap, but require a robotics specialist to put them together by hand before they're ready for use.\
	<br><br>\
	Grayson parts are appropriate for those of any income class, so long as they are willing to deal with the design's unwieldiness. This makes them most popular for those involved in construction or other manual labor, and some in police and private security have taken to using Grayson as a \"discount Hephaestus\"."

/datum/lore/codex/page/robo_morph
	name = "Morpheus Cyberkinetics"
	data = "One of the two TSCs with the most investment in the prosthetics market, Morpheus' design ethos sets them far apart from Bishop Cybernetics. Morpheus chassis are supposed to be the cheapest and most streamlined prosthetic bodies imaginable. Due to their minimalist construction methods, the chassis is often called 'skeletal' or 'insectoid', the parts often remaining unpainted, with wiring being run externally, rather than through the joints. Morpheus was also the first company to pioneer the now-popular \"monitorhead\" design, replacing time and material-intensive facial sculpting with a single mass-produced monitor.\
	<br><br>\
	Morpheus prosthetics are a popular choice for the positronic underclass. Richer synthetics usually upgrade to a more aesthetically pleasing design, while most humans find the distinctly inhuman sensory response from Morpheus products unnerving."

/datum/lore/codex/page/robo_bishop
	name = "Bishop Cybernetics"
	data = "Bishop is the other big-name prosthesis manufacturer. Despite their obviously mechanical appearance, Bishop products have a range of sensation rivaling that of Vey Medical, with proponents calling it even more comfortable and responsive. Simply occupying a Bishop chassis gives some the same sort of sensation one would get from a fast, well-maintained car or aircraft. Bishop products are most commonly sold in \"boutiques\" found throughout the richer regions of human space, and are custom-fit for the end-user's specifications.Externally, Bishop prosthetics have a distinctive chrome or airbrushed aluminum design, with carefully fitted blue lighting.\
	<br><br>\
	Bishop's exclusivity leads to them being most common among the wealthy, although upper-middle class technophiles have been known to invest in a high-quality prosthetic. \"Knock-offs\", usually chrome-plated NanoTrasen prosthetics with painted-on lines, are sometimes worn by poseurs."

/datum/lore/codex/page/robo_zh
	name = "Zeng-Hu Pharmaceuticals"
	data = "Zeng-Hu produces most of the \"lifelike\" prosthetics on the market. Unfortunately for those looking to return to their lives after a catastrophic accident, Zeng-Hu only maintains its profit margins on this product line by cutting corners. Zeng-Hu synthskin is significantly thicker than human skin and has been described as \"rubbery\". Zeng-Hu bodies also have obvious seam lines at the joints to lessen the structural stress on the synthskin covering. Additionally, Zeng-Hu standard facial sculpts all look fairly similar, though custom orders often avoid this problem. Nonetheless, ZH parts are the only option most people have for lifelike prosthetic limbs, and are lifelike enough to pass for human to casual inspection.\
	<br><br>\
	Zeng-Hu is available to individuals of average means and is a popular choice for drones designed for social interaction, who will probably have been paid for by their creators."

/datum/lore/codex/page/robo_veymed //the deed is done
	name = "Vey-Medical"
	data = "The most advanced humanoid prosthetic on the market, Vey-Med prides itself on its highly realistic synthskin, near-seamlessly integrated with the most sensitive tactile suite yet created (aside from that of Bishop, with whom they have a long-running friendly rivalry). Vey-Med seeks to be indistinguishable from a human body by both outside observers and by the patient themself, a point at which it succeeds handily.\
	The main downside to Vey-Med is its incredibly high pricetag-- easily comparable with that of a large house. Every Vey-Med piece is custom-sculpted for its individual owner, usually based on scans of the owner's previous body or the owner's family. Vey-Med also requires regular maintenance, lest the partially-organic synthskin that coats each piece begin to rot.\
	Many nouveau riche and lottery winners have splurged on a Vey-Med chassis, only to discover that they couldn't keep it maintained. Such individuals contribute to the large and semi-legal market of second, third, and fourth-hand Vey-Med chasses, which are cheaper than a store-bought one, but not by very much. Vey-Medical forbids resale of its prosthetics line, and works hard to shut down illicit sales. Potential buyers of a pre-owned Vey-Medical chassis should avoid deals that seem too good to be true, lest they discover that their new body is a Zeng-Hu with a layer of epoxy.\
	<br><br>\
	Vey-Med bodies are only accessible to the extremely wealthy, almost exclusively humans. Positronics find them unsettling in much the same way humans do Morpheus, and the idea of putting a drone in a Vey-Med body, if not a crude joke, is utterly ridiculous to anyone with any sort of sense. They are absolutely inappropriate for manual labor or combat, being fragile and usually fairly weak compared to other prosthetics."
