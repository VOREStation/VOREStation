	This book is for the system Virgo, and was written by Eshi Tache, an explorer whom has visited many star systems, and \

	book, being Qooqr Volquum, whom is an expert on synthetics, and Damian Fischer, a historian. Together, they provide valuable information and facts that lie outside of Tache's expertise.\
	<br><br>\
	The writings inside this edition are intended to be useful to anyone visiting it for the first time, from someone taking a vacation to beautiful Virgo-Prime, \
	to an immigrant from another system, or even from outside human space, and anyone inbetween. The publisher wishes to note that any opinions expressed \
	in this text does not reflect the opinions of the publisher, and are instead the author's.\
