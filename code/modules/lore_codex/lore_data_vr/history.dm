	The European Union and the Moscow-Delhi-Islamabad pact initiated a joint space program to lay the first bricks of our great successes as a nation.\
	<br><br>\
	Unfortunately, bluespace travel was beyond our reach - phoron had still been a mystery, its fruits denied to us.\
	But we were industrious, and began to colonise the gem of Humanity, Sol.\
	<br><br>\
	However, even without our stutter drives - we spread. With the aid of genetic engineering, we conquered space.\
	Despite wars, despite traitors upon Mars who fled to their holdouts in the Ares Confederacy once the speed of light\
	no longer tethered us - we thrived. By providence, our efforts were rewarded: phoron.\
	Out in the Oort cloud, beyond our reach if not for our forefather’s ambition despite their scarce resources and primitive technology\
	- phoron awaited us."

	data = "Come the twenty second century, we spread past our blue jewel. Once a mathematical curiosity penned by Lara Alden, \
	 then a confirmed fact by Dmitri Saraspova, and finally - an attainable commodity - we overcame the universal speed limit. \
	  Phoron, laden with bluespace catalysts, had made our dreams reality.\
	  <br><br>\
	  Cygnus, Procyon, Proxima Centauri and many, many more worlds our ancestors had once dreamed of, \
	  and that which had now become little more than a fact of life - had human boots kick up their dust.\
	  We have made first contact - the Skrell. An enigmatic species - but friendly.\
	  Unfortunately, with their technology came discord - their alien ways of life \
	  infecting our impressionable youth out on the frontiers, far from the wisdom of the core.\
	  <br><br> \
	  As wars peppered our history, as have they became a fact of life once more\
	  - rebellious, traitorous movements. World rejecting, foolishly, the yet-infant Commonwealth’s protection.\
	  As expected - most failed to maintain their “self-realisation” - and made amends for their prodigal ways.\
	  <br><br>\
	  All, but those of the Elysian Colonies. Too far from the core, and the core itself was too tumultuous \
	  - they broke away. One needs but look at worlds like Infernum \
	  or the mutt-world of New Eden to realise this was not a victory. \
	  Earth soon united under one banner, an inspiration to all of humanity.\
	  A scarcity of resources necessitates unity. And that unity will bring luxury, rebirth \
	  - one needs only wonder at the natural beauty of our home, the horrors of climate crises \
	  but a distant memory. One needs only look at Mars, and behold its miracle despite Aresian sabotage.\
	  <br><br>\
	  The Commonwealth was now born, proper and true. \
	  It was a prosperous age - with eager trade with our vulpkanin, skrell and tajaran friends."

	 Violating all that is just and fair, they conspired to weaken us in what are now the Salthan Fyrds\
	 by sending forth the Rapala. It is commendable how cunning they were - exploiting our mythologies, beliefs and similarities.\
	 <br><br>\
	 We traded, we aided each other. We offered fair compensation for their guidance.\
	 Then - the Unathi came, when we were most vulnerable and demanded the unthinkable\
	 - to surrender our Liberty, our Independence, our Individuality and Equality and become\
	 naught but another cog within their brutish protectorate.\
	 <br><br>\
	 Naturally, we rejected their demands.\
	 <br><br>\
	 Our war was costly - too costly, perhaps - but we persevered as Humanity is wont to do. \
	 Forty years of suffering destroyed much of what we had achieved.\
	 But in that forty years did our megacorporations step forth, offering aid where governments faltered.\
	 Where public science’s glacial pace would have cost us lives, forever lost - NanoTrasen’s medical research cheated death!\
	 Where Senate-governed mining operations would have wasted precious phoron to corruption \
	 - NanoTrasen stepped up and delivered twice what our armies needed! \
	 <br><br>\
	 Peace soon came - albeit, we had to give up the Fyrds to avoid further loss of life and profit.\
	 Something the short-sighted colonists refused to comply with.\
	 Perhaps - exposure to the treacherous ways of the Hegemony sullied their sense \
	 of honour as well - yet further proof of the dangers distance to \
	 elderly guidance can bring to young worlds. \
	 Although almost a century had passed since peace was signed, \
	 the break-away Fyrders still seek to threaten trade."

	Previously denied to us due to the astrogeographical hazards of the Core,\
	the Coreward Periphery brought humanity many fresh worlds with untapped wells\
