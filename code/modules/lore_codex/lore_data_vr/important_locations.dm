	system a popular location for Phoron research and refining.\
	<br><br>\
	Virgo-Erigone is mainly administered by [quick_link("Virgo-Erigone Governmental Authority","the Virgo-Erigone Governmental Authority")], which is owned by [quick_link("NanoTrasen")],\

	arrays of photo-voltaic panels. Each station harvests energy from Virgo-Erigone using the solar panels, and sends it to other areas of \
	the system by beaming the energy to several relay stations farther away from the star, typically with a large laser.\
	<br><br>\
	These stations are generally devoid of life, instead, they are operated mainly by [quick_link("drones")], with maintenance performed \
	by [quick_link("positronic")] equipped units in shielded chassis, or very brave humans in voidsuits that protect from extreme heat, and radiation. There are \

	Greyson Manufactories and [quick_link("Xion Manufacturing Group")]. In orbit, the two companies each have a space station, used to coordinate and \

	Below the surface of Virgo 2 are many natural cave systems, dangerous and easy to get lost inside, which both companies make heavy \
	use of. A noted rivalry exists between the two mining giants, as well as with smaller groups more interested in the xenoarcheological value of the alien ruins.\
	<br><br>\
	The very high temperatures, dangerous (sometimes magma-filled) caves, and the only presence of civilization being mining operations has made tourism \
	for Virgo 2 mostly non-existent, with the exception of explorers who specifically seek out hellish landscapes, which are plentiful with all the ruins, \

	The presence of several [quick_link("TSC", "TSCs")] on the surface has introduced new life forms to the planet via bioengineering, and now several 'new' species are commonly sighted per year. \
	Currently, [quick_link("NanoTrasen")] is constructing a 'space elevator' for commercial purposes, as the atmosphere of Virgo-3B is inimical to shuttles, and engines in particular."

	One of the most interesting facts about this planet is that it is the native [quick_link("Zorren")] race, who until recently \
	were a primitive and nomadic species.  Due to the arrival of various [quick_link("TSC", "TSCs")] over the last two decades, \
	the Zorren have benefitted greatly from the introduction of advanced technology into their culture. It is not known how many \
