	conservative body with a long history, tracing its linage back to the political unrest that created the Sol Confederate Government. Icarus calls \
	for severe restrictions on \"transformative technologies\" any technology with the power to fundamentally alter humanity, such as advanced artificial \
	intelligence and human genetic augmentation. Previously an unbeatable political force, recent changes have lead to its power backsliding. It remains a \
	popular party among those from Sol, Tau Ceti, and other heavily settled systems."

	data = "A disorganized liberal party, originating in an anti-[quick_link("Icarus")] shadow government.  'Shadow' in this case, refers to acting as an opposition \
	party to the Icarus majority. The Shadow Coalition calls for the lifting of certain Icarus-restricted technologies, especially medical \
	technologies with the ability to drastically improve quality of life. While fractious and prone to infighting, the Shadow Coalition and affiliated \

	corporate towns, such as the [quick_link("Northern Star")].\

	posed by positronics without human values in mind, self-described Mercurials still often find themselves persecuted or used by bioconservatives as scapegoats \

	the complete prohibition of [quick_link("Drone", "drone intelligence and AGI research")], with most also opposing the [quick_link("FTU", "FTU's")] plans for wide spread \

	Trans-Stellar who no longer see a benefit in working with SolGov. Full colonial independence is still a political impossibility so long as the \
	[quick_link("Icarus Front")] holds any sway, and so the Movement is focused primarily on securing more autonomy in governance, although a growing revolutionary sub-group \
	wants to force their change on the government en masse. The Multinational Movement finds themselves in an uneasy alliance with the [quick_link("SEO")], connected by their corporate, \

	measures to reduce the amount of power held by the TSCs. In many ways a holdover from the days before the [quick_link("Shadow Coalition")], where corporate malfeasance took \
	the place of technological development as the primary issue of debate, the FTU has found itself adopting technological positions similar to the SEO as a matter \
	of pragmatism, although the views of individual members vary. The FTU is known for their intense lobbying of SolGov to add tax rebates to the purchases of \
	personal lathes and the creation of open-source firmware for experimental autolathes, but have thus far found little success."
