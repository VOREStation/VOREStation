	data = "Vir is an A-type main sequence star with 81% more mass than Sol (the humans' home star), and almost nine times as bright.  It \
	has a white glow, and a diameter that is about 34% larger than Sol. It has six major planets in its orbit.\
	<br><br>\
	Vir is mainly administered on [quick_link("Sif")] by the [quick_link("Sif Governmental Authority")], as Sif \
	was the first planet to be colonized, however SGA lays claim to all planets orbiting Vir.  The planets \
	are named after figures in ancient human mythology (Norse), due to the original surveyor for the system deciding to do so. \
	Some installations carry on this tradition."

	data = "A sparse government-owned chain of automated stations exists between Firnir and the star itself. The idea is based on \
	an ancient design that was pioneered at Sol. The stations are heavily shielded from the stellar radiation, and feature massive \
	arrays of photo-voltaic panels. Each station harvests energy from Vir using the solar panels, and sends it to other areas of \
	the system by beaming the energy to several relay stations farther away from the star, typically with a large laser.\
	<br><br>\
	These stations are generally devoid of life, instead, they are operated mainly by [quick_link("drones")], with maintenance performed \
	by [quick_link("positronic")] equipped units in shielded chassis, or very brave humans in voidsuits that protect from extreme heat, and radiation. There are \
	currently 19 stations in operation."

	keywords += list("Tyr")
	data = "The second closest planet to [quick_link("Vir")], this planet has a high concentration of minerals inside its crust, as well as active volcanism and plate tectonics.  \
	The temperature on the surface can reach up to 405 degrees kelvin (132°C), which has deterred most people from the planet, except for two [quick_link("TSC", "TSCs")], \
	Greyson Manufactories and [quick_link("Xion Manufacturing Group")].  In orbit, the two companies each have a space station, used to coordinate and \
	control their stations on the surface without having to suffer the intense heat.  Xion's station also doubles as a control and oversight facility for their \
	[quick_link("drones","autonomous mining drones")].\
	<br><br>\
	Remnants of both Greyson and Xion's mining operations dot the surface, as well as ruins of mining \
	outposts build by an unknown alien civilization, which researchers have noted it appears to be similar to ruins found inside the rings of [quick_link("Kara")] \
	and on [quick_link("Sif")] itself.  Below the surface of Tyr are many natural cave systems, dangerous and easy to get lost inside, which both companies make heavy \
	use of.  A noted rivalry exists between the two mining giants, as well as with smaller groups more interested in the xenoarcheological value of the alien ruins.\
	<br><br>\
	The very high temperatures, dangerous (sometimes magma-filled) caves, and the only presence of civilization being mining operations has made tourism \
	for Tyr mostly non-existent, with the exception of explorers who specifically seek out hellish landscapes, which are plentiful with all the ruins, \
	volcanoes, twisting caves, and general lawlessness.  The occasional remains of previous explorers near certain hotspots somehow does not deter them."

	equatorial city and site of the first settlement, New Reykjavik, which houses the [quick_link("Sif Governmental Authority")].\
	<br><br>\
	Sif has many desirable traits which made it the first planet to be colonized in Vir, however it also has various quirks which \
	may disorient humans used to conditions on planet Earth.  Atmospheric pressure is lower than 'normal', which may cause difficulty \
	breathing if you are used to climate controlled artifical habitats or higher pressure planets.  The gravity is also slightly lower, at \
	only 90% the strength of planet Earth's gravity. You may need to keep two clocks if you plan to visit \
	or live on Sif, as the planet takes over 32 hours to complete one day.  A Sif year also takes just under five Earth years."

	or organisations.  The position of the spaceport allows it to function not only as a key node for transport inside the Vir \
	system, especially to and from the planet Sif, but also as a key stopping point interstellar craft travelling via Vir which need refuelling. \
	<br><br>\
	The station itself is mostly designed around its logistical and commercial needs, and although other strategically-placed \
	nearby facilities owned by a mixture of corporations and entities may possess habitation space, the port itself is not \
	designed to be a living habitat - its proximity to the surface of Sif makes transport of people and materials to and from \
