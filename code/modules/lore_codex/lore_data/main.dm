	This book is for the system Vir, and was written by Eshi Tache, an explorer whom has visited many star systems, and \

	to an immigrant from another system or even from outside human space, and anyone inbetween.  The publisher wishes to note that any opinions expressed \
	in this text does not reflect the opinions of the publisher, and are instead the author's.\
