	name = "08/30/61-- VGA Legalizes Prometheans; Nanotrasen Begins Manufacture and Testing"
	data = "Today's meeting of the Vir Bicameral led to the passing of the Wynther-Helsey Bill, an implementation of the legal framework \
	used in Aetolus to handle the production and cultivation of the Macrolimbus species dubbed \"Prometheans\". These ill-researched organisms \
	possess cognitive abilities easily equaling those of A-class drones, but so far have not been included under the EIO's list of dangerous \
	intelligences and are thus much more profitable for manufacture as expert systems by corporations such as NanoTrasen.\
	<br></br>\
	While many systems in the Almach Rim have already passed similar bills, this is the first system so close to Sol to have done so. More\
	concerning still is NanoTrasen's business practice regarding the intelligences: much like their positronic lines, sources within the\
	company indicate that they will be \"farmed out\" to employees of the corporation and residents of their Northern Star and Cynosure\
	habitation complexes. Quote our source, who wishes to remain anonymous, \"\[we\] call the program 'Lend-Lease', sometimes. The whole idea\
	is that we only have to pay the\ cost of the Promethean core, which is about 2000-3000 thalers after startup costs, and we still get\
	the data we need while \[our\] own employees pay to feed 'em and put hours into raising them.\"\
	<br></br>\
	The bill passed fairly quietly this afternoon, owing to the closed nature of the Bicamarial. A post-facto Occulum poll of voting-age\
	VGA citizens suggest that fully 80% of them did not even know what a Promethean was prior to the most recent general election. A\
	follow-up poll indicates that an appreciable number of Sivians do not support the framework's current implementation."
