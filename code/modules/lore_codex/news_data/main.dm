	name = "08/30/61 - VGA Legalizes Prometheans; Nanotrasen Begins Manufacture and Testing"
	data = "Today's meeting of the Vir Bicameral led to the passing of the Wynther-Helsey Bill, an implementation of the legal framework \
	used in Aetolus to handle the production and cultivation of the Macrolimbus species dubbed \"Prometheans\". These ill-researched organisms \
	possess cognitive abilities easily equaling those of A-class drones, but so far have not been included under the EIO's list of dangerous \
	intelligences and are thus much more profitable for manufacture as expert systems by corporations such as NanoTrasen.\
	<br></br>\
	While many systems in the Almach Rim have already passed similar bills, this is the first system so close to Sol to have done so. More\
	concerning still is NanoTrasen's business practice regarding the intelligences: much like their positronic lines, sources within the\
	company indicate that they will be \"farmed out\" to employees of the corporation and residents of their Northern Star and Cynosure\
	habitation complexes. Quote our source, who wishes to remain anonymous, \"\[we\] call the program 'Lend-Lease', sometimes. The whole idea\
	is that we only have to pay the\ cost of the Promethean core, which is about 2000-3000 thalers after startup costs, and we still get\
	the data we need while \[our\] own employees pay to feed 'em and put hours into raising them.\"\
	<br></br>\
	The bill passed fairly quietly this afternoon, owing to the closed nature of the Bicamarial. A post-facto Occulum poll of voting-age\
	VGA citizens suggest that fully 80% of them did not even know what a Promethean was prior to the most recent general election. A\
	follow-up poll indicates that an appreciable number of Sivians do not support the framework's current implementation."

	name = "2/3/62 - Corporate Coup on Aetolus"
	data = "A recent incident aboard the NRS Prometheus issued in a major change in the leadership of the Promethean homeworld. During \
	a late-night meeting of the Nanotrasen Board of Trustees, several high-ranking personnel, including Head of Research Naomi Harper,\
	announced their intention to assume direct control of Nanotrasen facilities in the system. It is known that several dissenting \
	members of the board were shot to death by Promethean test subjects. Our information comes from a survivor of the coup, who for \
	reasons of security has chosen to remain annonymous. All outbound shipments affiliated with Nanotrasen have ceased.\
	<br><br>\
	While neither Grayson Manufacturies nor Nanotrasen have made an official statement, Nanotrasen CEO Albary Moravec has called the \
	incident \"shocking, if the allegations are to be believed\" and has assured shareholders that Nanotrasen will respond to the \
	incident with as much force as it warrents.<br><br>Requests for a statement directed to the Board of Trustees or Dr. Harper were \
	not responded to. Free Traders are recommended to stay clear of the region until the situation resolves itself."

	name = "2/10/62 - Aetolian Partisans Declare Independence"
	data = "Breaking their week-long silence, the leaders of the Aetolian Coup, and their spokesperson and presumed leader Naomi Harper issued an address earlier today, delivered to the Oculum Broadcast office on Pearl by drone courier. Quote Dr. Harper: \"Our previous silence was a necessity, while we consolidated our forces and dealt with corporatists both internally and in Vounna's former Grayson outposts.\". In Harper's hour-long address, she berates the failure of SolGov to provide adequate protections for Prometheans. \"We will not let the Promethean be another positronic brain; they will not labor under a century of slavery, deprived of a state to call their own. The Luddites of the Friends and of the Icarus Front will not be permitted to decide the fate of a nascent race before it begins.\"\
	<br><br>\
	Harper proceeded to unilaterally declare Vounna's independence from SolGov, claiming sovereignty over the system as the first Chairperson of the \"Aetolian Council\". Speaker of the Shadow Coalition ISA-5 has urged their government to treat the developing situation with caution but decried Harper's rhetoric, stating in a press release, \"While I know well the injustices visited on myself and my people by misguided forbearers, it is important to treat any emerging technology with respect. Current policies regarding the Prometheans are designed to limit risk during sociological trials on Aetolus and beyond. As for myself, I doubt the sincerity of this human who claims to speak for the Prometheans, when the Prometheans are perfectly equipped to speak for themselves.\"\
	<br><br>\
	NanoTrasen is expected to redouble their Promethean research programs in the Vir system until stability is restored to Vounna."

	name = "2/14/62 - SCG Denounces Aetolian Coup; Mobilizes Fleet"
	data = "Dismissing claims of inaction, a spokesperson for the Solar Confederate Government today confirmed that the Colonial Assembly has voted overwhelmingly in favor of swift military action in response to the coup on Aetolus earlier this month. Icarus Front Chairperson Mackenzie West was quick to make a damning official statement: \"Dr. Harper and her radical agitators cannot be excused for their violent, despicable attempts to destabilize the flourishing economy of the Almach Rim. The ruthless murder of innocents, and illegal seizure of private property are crimes that cannot merely be met with strong words and gentle slaps to the wrist\"...\"I am proud to announce that two units of brave Solar marines have been assigned to the SCG-R Song Shi rapid response cruiser, with the full backing of the Icarus Front - and I hope with my heart, the backing of all patriotic Solar citizens.\"\
	<br><br>\
	The decision faced resistance from more laissez faire Assembly member states, including prominent SEO governor Bruno Ofako, delaying an earlier consensus. Supporters of the action hope that this decisive display of military strength will encourage the rebels to stand down without further bloodshed, and submit to prosecution by the Lunar High Courts.\
	<br><br>\
	The Icarus Front has also proposed a temporary ban on continued Promethean research, though this motion has yet to gain any traction."

	name = "2/23/62 - \"Almach Association\" Shocks Nation"
	data = "Shocking the nation, in the wee hours UTC a number of governments in the Almach Rim announced their intent to secede from the Confederacy as a unified political organization they refer to as the Almach Association, joining the already-declared Aetolian Council. Among the half-dozen affected systems is Angessa's Pearl, through which the Song Shi was passing en route to Aetolus. The Association has already issued a political manifesto and a foundational charter, leading political scientists across the galaxy to suspect back-doors collusion and possible Shelfican interference, a hypothesis made more likely by Morpheus Cyberkinetics' exonet site voicing support for the Association. Others suspect a moment of political crystallization, not unlike that in the Golden Hour three centuries ago. These researchers are already referring to this morning's events as the Gray Hour.\
	<br><br>\
	The Association's official manifesto repudiates the Five Points, calling them \"an archaic and distinctly human invention\". Experts agree that this bold declaration puts the Movement more in line with the Golden Hour than with the Age of Secession, and many fear that nothing short of a miracle like the discovery of the positronics will spare humanity from a bloody civil war.\
	<br><br>\
	While the Association currently lists only a handful of Almach Rim systems as \"Constituent Organizations\", it has named Shelf, the Free Relan Federation, and the Eutopian Foreign Relations Board as \"observers\". The implications of this status are yet to be identified.\
	<br><br>\
	The fate of the SCG-R Song Shi and her crew remain unknown."

	data = "* Several organizations in the Almach Rim, including Angessa's Pearl, the Aetolian Council, the Interstellar Workers of Wythe, the Republic of Whitney, and members of several prominent families in the Neon Light unilaterally declared secession from SCG. <br><br>*This secession was first called the Grey Hour by political scientists in New Florence, a term popularized by reporter Elspor Fong. <br><br>* Shelf, the FRF, and the EFRB were declared \"observers\" in the Almach Association charter. <br><br>* None of these organizations have issued a statement on the matter.<br><br>* The SCG-R Song Shi was stranded in the region during the secession.<br><br>* SolGov has not issued an official statement of the fate of the Song Shi.<br><br>* Several confederate agencies, including Emergent Intelligence Oversight, the Trade and Customs Bureau, and SCG Fleet Intelligence have declared a \"state of emergency\".<br><br>* SolGov itself has NOT declared a state of emergency.<br><br>* Legitimate communications in and out of the Almach Rim are restricted to audited text messages for the period.<br><br>* Several illegitimate communication links exist and are believed by Fleet Intelligence to be currently hosting the official sites for Morpheus Cyberkinetics and for the Association itself.<br><br>* Icarus Front chairperson Mackenzie West has proposed a moratorium on the creation of new Prometheans for the duration of the crisis.<br><br>* Local laws on the subject will apply until the Assembly meets late in May. <br><br>* No confederate lawmaker has proposed action against Relani, Shelfican, or newly Almachi nationals living within stable regions.<br><br>* The border remains tightly closed to migrants, media, and diplomats alike."

	name = "3/21/62 - Relan, Shelf Join the Almach Association"
	data = "Recent reports from within the Association indicate that the Free Relan Federation and Shelf have officially decided to join the Almach Association. President Nia Fischer of the FRF had this to say on the matter, in a speech addressed to the population at large. \
	<br><br>\
	\
	\"Our decision to join the Association may, at first, seem strange. It is true that we have much to gain from trade with the Solars, and that the radical transhumanism of Angessa's Pearl is not our way. But I will remind you that it was Shelf, not Sol, who ensured our prosperity just over two decades ago-- who safeguarded our independence and prevented us from falling to barbarism and dictatorship. We owe it, not just to Shelf but to all the members of the Almach Rim, to support their independence just the same. And that, my fellow Relanians, is the crux of it all. The Association is a revolution, at the heart of it all, and many of the now-independent states were owned near-outright by Trans-Stellar Corporations until the Association allowed them to shake out their fetters. What right do we have to sit by while just a dozen light-years coreward newly-born republics suffer the growing pains of independence? What right do we have to bask in our own stability when our neighbors, our comrades in ideology, are struggling with a cruel blockade proposed by politicians back on Earth and Luna? That is why we must join with them, guard them, and guide them, for as long as need be.\"\
	<br><br>\
	\
	A Shelfican spokesperson, meanwhile, had only this to say:\
	<br><br>\
	\"We're probably going to regret this but, y'know, the whole thing is kind of our fault. Sure, whatever.\""

	name = "4/1/62 - Almach Cordon Breached by Unknown Organization"
	data = "Early this morning, SolGov ships assigned to the Almach Cordon around the Rim territories reported that a number of bulk freighters had eluded apprehension and are now at large within the Golden Crescent. Lieutenant-Major Volkov of the SCG-D Henri Capet reports that the blockade-runners were highly organized and determined, citing several lightly-manned ships left behind to tie up the SolGov forces long enough for the freighters to escape, detonating their reactors when they lost the ability to continue fighting. This resulted in three Fleet casualties and a significant degree of damage to the Henri Capet. The contents and location of the freighters are unknown at this time. In response, eight light-response vessels are being assigned to the Saint Columbia Fleet Base from Jahan's Post and Zhu Que. Residents and traffic officials in Vir, Oasis, and Gavel are to remain alert and notify police if any suspicious or unregistered craft enter their space.\
	<br><br>\
	A spokesperson for the Association claims that, while they make no attempts to stop aspiring blockade runners, the organization responsible for this most recent attack is unaffiliated with the Association as a whole and deny any knowledge of their identity or motives."

	name = "4/7/62 - Boiling Point Tragedy in Gavel"
	data = "Today, April the Seventh, marks a day of tragedy for all the galaxy. A small group of operatives claiming to be associated with Mercurial terrorist organization Boiling Point invaded major refueling platform NLS Aquarius in the Republic of Gavel after hijacking civilian transport vessel WTV Orion and faking a drive failure. Several detonations were reported within the Aquarius, the operatives entering through unknown (potentially Skrellian) means. After stating their affiliation and desire for the liberation of all \"Prometheans, drones, and ex-humans\", they opened fire on a crowd of unarmed bystanders, killing as many as seven. A multiple-hour long firefight with Nanotrasen corporate asset protection ensued, at which point the operatives demonstrated capabilities well in excess of Five Points-prescribed limits. Asset Protection was successful in repelling the terrorists, though their harsh methods drew outrage from the people they were protecting, leading a notable director of research to resign her position with the corporation. Several operatives are still at large, though the SG-PV Juno recovered two living terrorists and one totaled synthetic platform. \
	<br><br>\
	The intervention of a local Defense Force drone wing on behalf of the terrorists leads many in the intelligence community to assume that more Boiling Point operatives remain active within Gavel, and possibly nearby systems such as Vir and Oasis. Some have also noted that elements of the terrorists' tactics and augmentations suggest Association training, though the specifics remain classified. More information as the story breaks."
