	<ul>\
	<li>\[0\] <b>Safety</b>: Upon arrival at the scene, first assess if it is safe to begin treatment and recovery. Your safety is the most important part of \
	performing first aid; a wounded medic is worse than useless, they're now a patient.</li>\
	<li>\[1\] <b>Dying</b>: These patients are non-responsive and critical, but are still alive. Stasis bag them for transport back to the medical bay.</li>\
	<li>\[2\] <b>Wounded</b>: These patients are Severely Injured, but not yet in danger of dying. Anyone who is unable to travel to the medical bay under their \
	own power who, and who is not also dying, falls under this diagnosis. Treat these as appropriate for their injuries, being wary of worsening vital signs, and \
	prepare to transport them back to medical if necessary.</li>\
	<li>\[3\] <b>Injured</b>: These patients are injured, but not in need of immediate medical treatment. If possible, treat them on scene.</li>\
	<li>\[4\] <b>Dead</b>: The dead are to be gathered in body bags, and returned to the medical bay in preparation for postmortem instructions.</li>\

	name = "Cloning Procedures"
	data = "Persons whom have committed suicide are not to be cloned, without authorization from the Chief Medical Officer.  \
	The Chief Medical Officer is fully responsible if they choose to clone a person whom has committed suicide.  \
	Individuals are also to not be cloned if there is a Do Not Clone (generally referred to as DNC) order in their medical records, \
	or if the individual has had a DNC order declared against them by the Station Director, Chief Medical Officer, or Head of Security.  \
	If any of this occurs, procede to Portmortem Storage.\
	<br><br>\
	Some individuals may have special instructions in their Postmortem Instructions, generally found in their medical records.  \
	Be sure to read them before committing to cloning someone.  In particular, some instructions may express a desire to be placed \
	inside a synthetic body.  If this is the case, contact Robotics.  If robotics is not available, and no instructions for \
	cloning exist in their records, proceed to Postmortem Storage.\
	<br><br>\
	If no records are included, it is assumed that the patient wishes to be cloned, and should be cloned.\
	<br><br>\
	Ensure that all cloning equipment, including the cryogenic tubes, are functional and ready before cloning begins.  Once \
	this is done, scan the deceased.  Up to three scans are to be made per attempt.  If the deceased suffers Mental Interface Failure, \
	procede to Postmortem Storage.  Further attempts at resuscitation may be made at later times, at the medical teams' discretion. \
	<br><br>\
	If the deceased is sufficently scanned, remove their possessions and clothing off of the deceased body, for use by the future new clone.  \
	Move the cadaver into the morgue, as per Postmortem Storage.  Begin the cloning process.  Possessions are to be gathered in a manner that \
	facilitates transporting them along with the clone.  Upon the cloning process being complete and the new clone being created, the \
	clone is to be placed inside a croygenic tube as quickly as possible.  Cloning is not a painless experience, and it is best if \
	the patient reawakens inside a functional body.  Once their body is fully functional, dress and process the newly cloned patient, \
	informing them of any procedures performed on them, including the cloning itself."

	capability.  Those exposed to vacuum without protection will almost certainly require advanced medical care, so bring anyone harmed to Medical.  \
	Remember to avoid risking your own life, as stated in the Triage section."
