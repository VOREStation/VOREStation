	the Sif Governmental Authority and the Solar Confederate Government. The legal interactions between Nanotrasen corporate policy and SGA/SolGov \
	law can make for some confusing legalese.  This book was written by the Vir division of NanoTrasen in order for employees, visitors, and residents \
	at NanoTrasen installations such as the Northen Star and the Southen Cross to know what isn't allowed, without needing to be a lawyer to read it.\
	<br><br>\
	In this book, there are two different types of rules.  Corporate Regulations, and Laws.  They each cover specific situations, and are both enforced \
	by the Security team.  Despite this, however, the punishments vary considerably for the two types.  It should also be noted that no one is above \
	these rules, not even the Station Director.\
	<br><br>\
	Also contained inside are our Standard Operating Procedures, that all employees of NanoTrasen are expected to follow, and for the local facility's \
	Command team and Internal Affairs to enforce.\
	<br><br>\
	It should be noted that by being on-board our facility, you agree to follow the rules of Corporate Regulations. By being within SGA space, \
	you are also required to follow the laws of SifGov."
