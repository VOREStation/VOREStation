//Refurbished Set
//Voidsuits from old Terran exploration vessels and naval ships.

//Standard Crewsuit (GRAY)
//Nothing really special here. Some light resists for mostly-non-combat purposes. The rad protection ain't bad?
//The reduced slowdown is an added bonus - something to make it worth considering using if you do find it.
