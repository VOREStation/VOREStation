/// This file contains everything that involves the borg overlay system that is applied to borgs in robot/sprites_sprite_datum.dm

/// These are applied ON /datum/robot_sprite to tell it what overlays it can or can not have.

/// If you make a borg that has a laser, taser, and shield, here's an Example:
/// sprite_flags = ROBOT_HAS_LASER_SPRITE | ROBOT_HAS_TASER_SPRITE | ROBOT_HAS_SHIELD_SPRITE

/// NOTES: You are NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A GUN SPRITE IF YOU HAVE A DEDICATED LASER/TASER/DISABLER SPRITE. Doing so will cause BAD THINGS to happen!!!
/// IMPORTANT: Flags operate on a 1 2 4 8 10 20 40 80 100 200 400 800 1000 2000 4000 8000 etc system. Not 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 like I thought at first (oops)

/// GUN DEFINES
/// These are applied on GUNS to classify them as a GUN, TASER, OR LASER.
/// So every borg weapon is a child of '/obj/item/gun/energy/robotic' and given the 'laser' 'taser' 'gun' etc flag. ALL guns have 'gun' by default.

/// MELEE WEAPON DEFINES
/// These are applied on MELEE WEAPONS to classify them as MELEE WEAPONS that give sprites.
/// Use 'melee' if your borg ONLY has a generic melee sprite. If they have more unique sprites, use the other ones!
/// Currently, only the borg blade is used. But you could expand this define list!

/// ADDITIONAL NOTES:
/// If you want to have a special type of item that will be used on borgs that is NOT a gun OR is not included above that causes an overlay, have no fear!
/// Currently, the SHIELD, SPEED, and both are included. If you want your borg to have a cool special overlay, use 'handle_extra_icon_updates'!
/// Here's an example:

/*
/datum/robot_sprite/combat/fluff/foopwotch/handle_extra_icon_updates(var/mob/living/silicon/robot/ourborg) //Make sure the path is correct!
	..() //THIS IS ESSENTIAL. IF YOU FORGET THIS LINE, YOU WILL NOT GET THE NORMAL SPRITES.
