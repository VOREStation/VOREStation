	name = "Mi'jri Peninsula"
	desc = "The peninsula is an area that remains sloped down to the shores due to freezing and thawing constantly chewing away at the land. \
	Much of the sediment is then collected to the shore lines which most of the year are frozen beaches. This area is popular for fishing for \
	the Nazkiin, and is a major source of most of their food."

	and small mountains dotting the landscape. One specific area of note is what is referred to as the \"Crater of Light.\" In the Slavemaster era, \
	the Crater was used as a mine for most of the raw minerals the Slavemaster's had, and was the main site of the Nothern Plains Mining Network. \
	Since the fall of the Slavemasters, the Hadii have fought tooth and nail to preserve hold of it, believing S'randarr gave it to them, \
	and those of Tajr-kii S'randarr must keep it away from the followers of Messa."

	desc = "A Slavemaster-era mining complex, now owned, operated, and supplied by NT. The Slavemasters cleared out a large portion of the area's \
	mineral wealth, but not all was depleted prior to their leaving.  Tajaran employed from nearby towns hail mostly from those days and are glad to \

	desc = "A large area of more rugged terrain than the plains to the south. Near the coast to the Rrhazkal Ice Maw, the area has a \

	desc = "The larger world that Ahdomai orbits. It is often mythologically associated as S'randarr's Shield, and is informally known \
	as Shield among the Tajaran and formally among the humans. It is uninhabitable, as it has a largely methane atmosphere and lacks water \
	or other features necessary to life. Nonetheless, a domed, underdeveloped colony exists, called Hran'vasa, heavily funded by Osiris Atmospherics, \
	practically the only non-Ahdomain official holding for the Tajaran race. It is incredibly dependant on outside support and imports for life, \
	but has a high export of noble gasses for corporate use."

/datum/locations/messa

	desc = "The blue unstably-ringed gas planet, associated with the Tajaran goddess of death and change. By the superstitious and religious, \
	it is considered a bad omen when Messa is the only one in the sky. It is also said the rings are the souls Messa has clung on to, and is consuming."

	are said to be in limbo between S'randarr and Messa, as they both fight over them."
