// TO ANYBODY LOOKING AT THIS FILE:
// Everything is mostly commented on to give as much detailed information as possible.
// Some things may be difficult to understand, but every variable in here has a comment explaining what it is/does.
// The base unit, the 'personal_shield_generator' is a backpack, comes with a gun, and has normal numbers for everything.
// The belt units do NOT come with a gun and have a cell that is half the capacity of backpack units.
// These can be VERY, VERY, VERY strong if too many are handed out, the cell is too strong, or the modifier is too strong.
// Additionally, if you are mapping any of these in, ensure you map in the /loaded versions or else they won't have a battery.
// I have also made it so you can modify everything about them, including the modifier they give and the cell, which can be changed via mapping.

// In essence, these can be viewed as an extra layer of armor that has upsides and downsides with more extensive features.
// Shield generators apply PRE armor. Ultimately this shouldn't matter too much, but it makes more sense this way.
// There are a good amount of variants in here, ranging from mining to security to misc ones.
// If you want to make a variant, you need to only change modifier_type and make the modifier desired.
