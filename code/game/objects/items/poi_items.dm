	desc = "In the year 1957, the United States of America - an Earth nation - performed a series \
	of earth nuclear weapons tests codenamed 'Operation Plumbbob', which remain the largest and \
	longest running nuclear test series performed on the American continent. Test data included \
	various altitude detonations, effects on several materials and structures at various \
	distances, and the effects of radiation on military hardware and the human body. \
	<br><br>\
	On the 27th of August that year, in a test named 'Pascal-B' a 300t nuclear payload \
	was buried in a shaft capped by a 900kg steel plate cap. The test was intended to \
	verify the safety of underground detonation, but the shaft was not sufficient to \
	contain the shockwave. According to experiment designer Robert Brownlee, the steel \
	cap was propelled upwards at a velocity of 240,000km/h - over six times Earth's \
	escape velocity. The cap appeared in only one frame of high-speed camera recording. \
	<br><br>\
	It had been theorized that the cap had exited earth's atmosphere and entered orbit. \
	It would seem the cap traveled farther than had been possibly imagined."

	as preferable to evacuating a ship's crew and potentially losing the entire craft and its cargo. \

	on the 14th April 2353, citing major systems malfunction following a fire in the engine compartment. \

	Growth Inhibitor Type 78-1 is used in the rapid artificial maturation process to prevent the 'overdevelopment' of\

	devastating damage to living tissue, ceasing all regenerative activity in an organism's cells. While immediate effects\
	can be halted by recent medical innovations, exposure can severely shorten a sapient's life expectancy.\
