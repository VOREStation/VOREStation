	desc = "Several types of precursor objects observed so far appear to be driven by electricity, however the \
	source appears to be from self contained objects, with no apparent means of generation being visible.\
	To anyone with a basic understanding of physics, that should not be possible, due to appearing to be a \
	perpetual motion machine.\
	<br><br>\
	This phenomenon has been given the term 'void power' by this device, until adaquate information becomes available. \
	Several possible explainations exists for this behaviour;\
	<br>\
	<ul>\
		<li>* These objects do, in fact, power themselves for free, and the modern understanding of the physical world \
		 is in fact incorrect. This is the most obvious answer, but it is very unlikely to be true.</li>\
		<li>* The objects draw from an unknown source of energy that exists at all points in space, or at least where the \
		void powered machine was found, that presently cannot be detected or determined, and converts that energy into electrical energy \
		to drive the machine it is inside of.</li>\
		<li>* The objects appear to power themselves, but are actually giving the appearance of being a closed system, when instead \
		an unknown, external object or machine is transferring power through an unknown means to the primary system being \
		powered, acting as a non-physical conduit. This might be the most likely explaination, however it would open many new \
		questions as well, such as how the hypothesized external machine is able to transfer power without any physical \
		interactions inbetween, or the distance between the true source of power and the void powered object, which  could \
		be vast, possibly across star systems or even originating from outside the galaxy.</li>\
	</ul>\
	Regardless of the method, it is remarkable how the electrical systems have resisted entrophy and remained functional to this day. \
	Unfortunately, the extreme rarity of these objects, combined with small throughput, means that humanity will not become a \
	post-scarcity civilization from this discovery, but instead might have a few permanent flashlights."
