/*
USAGE NOTE
For decals, the var Persistent = 'has already been saved', and is primarily used to prevent duplicate savings of generic filth (filth.dm).
This also means 'TRUE' can be used to define a decal as "Do not save at all, even as a generic replacement." if a dirt decal is considered 'too common' to save.
generic_filth = TRUE means when the decal is saved, it will be switched out for a generic green 'filth' decal.
