The libvchatlog.so/vchatlog.dll file will fetch the required database credentials automatically from the
config/dbconfig.txt if the chatlogging database backend was enabled.

For the alwayson-backend you will have to create some kind of service to keep it running. With the supplied
.env.example you are able to set the port of the API. The configured chatlogging API URL (where you also turn it on)
you will have to supply the correct ip-address/domain and port on where this API is reachable.

For this you can set the DBCONFIG_PATH environment variable (or use the .env.example) to the exact path of the config/dbconfig.txt.



Do not forget to rename .env.example to .env of course, if you want to use a file.
